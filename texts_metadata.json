With the advent of technologies such as 5G, Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Augmented/Virtual Reality (AR/VR) and Metaverse, India is poised to unlock new opportunities for growth and innovation. 5G services have been launched worldwide in many countries. In India, it was launched on 1 st October 2022 and the Telecom Service Providers are aggressively rolling out the 5G network across the length and breadth of the country. However, development and deployment of new use cases for consumers and enterprises is essential to fully realize the potential of 5G technology. Such applications and use cases involve other associated technologies such as IOT, AI, AR/VR/MR (Mixed Reality), Metaverse etc. Innovators are exploring new ways to apply these technologies to address the challenges of social and economic development and build a smart society. To complement their efforts, an equally innovative policy and regulatory framework is required to address the challenges and issues involved in development and deployment of use cases based on these new technologies. India is one of the fastest-growing digital economies in the world, with a huge potential for data -driven innovation and value creation. For realizing this potential for overall growth of economy a forward-looking policy framework for data monetization is required. The Authority has come out with this consultation paper on suo-motu basis to identify the policy challenges and suggest the right policy framework for faster adoption and effective utilisation of new technologies for the holistic and sustainable development of the economy driven by 5G ecosystem. 2 Chapter – 1 INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND I. Significance of Fast and Reliable Mobile Broadband Connectivity 1.1 Internet has become ingrained into the daily life of the people across the world. From obtaining information on markets or health, to making mobile payments, the Internet has made each task much easier. Fast and reliable mobile broadband connectivity is essential for achieving the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals and for fostering innovation and economic growth. India is home to the world’s second largest pool of 825 million mobile broadband users, and each mobile data user consumes more than 17 GB of data per month on an average. The dependency on the internet became even more profound in a post -COVID world as it became an integral part of our daily lives. In 2020, the Supreme Court of India identified access to information via the internet as a fundamental right under the Indian constitution. 1.2 In fact, digital services, underpinned by high speed and high-performance internet, are set to become more integral to society in a post -pandemic world. The unconnected populations will be at greater risk of exclusion from many life-enhancing digital services. The mobile industry has b een instrumental in extending the internet connectivity to people around the world. At the end of 2022, the number of mobile internet subscribers reached 8.4 billion1 globally. Mobile ownership and internet usage are expected to keep growing in the future , as mobile technologies are becoming more affordable and accessible than ever before. This upward trend in mobile internet adoption is particularly visible in developing digital markets where mobile networks are the primary means of internet 1Ericssson Mobility Report – Update Feb2023 3 access.

Almost every industry is embracing accelerated digital transformation. Organisations have very quickly adapted to the new w ays of operating remotely and in a hybrid model. Mainstream use of Artificial Intelligence ( AI), Internet of Things (IoT), Augmented/Virtual Reality (AR/VR) technologies in sectors such as education, healthcare, e-commerce has brought up a need of high spe ed and high bandwidth internet. 5G and beyond communication technologies have the potential to fulfil these requirements. 1.4 India is moving towards digital transformation with the objective of re - imagining and re -inventing every single element of governance. Digital India is an umbrella programme that covers multiple Government Ministries and Departments. It weaves together a large number of ideas and thoughts into a single, comprehensive vision so that each of them can be implemented as part of a larger goal. There are nine pillars supporting the Digital India program. i. Broadband Highways – include Broadband for all in Urban and Rural areas and National Information Infrastructure. ii. Universal Access to Mobile Connectivity: Initiative is to focus on network penetration and cover the uncovered villages with project cost of USD 1900 million. iii. Public Internet Access Programme: BharatNet project provides fibre connectivity to villages. For digital delivery of e-services, 535,000 Common Service Centres have been set up. iv. e-Governance: Government Business Process Re-engineering using IT to improve transactions and e-services. 2 https://www.statista.com/statistics/277125/share-of-website-traffic-coming-from-mobile-devices/ 4 v. e-Kranti - Electronic Delivery of Services: 31 Mission Mode Projects to establish e-Governance in all Ministries/Departments including e-Courts and e-Prosecution. vi. Information for All: Open Data platform and online hosting of information and documents would facilitate open and easy access to information for citizens. vii. Electronic Manufacturing: Target is net zero import. viii. IT for Jobs : focuses on providing training to the youth in the skills required for availing employment opportunities in the IT/ITES sector. ix. Early Harvest Programmes : consists of those projects which are to be implemented within short timeline. 1.5 Fast and reliable mobile communication technologies are helping the Government in realising the objectives of Digital India programme. It is providing a boost to our economy and empowering the citizens through services like unified payment interface (UPI) and several other innovative G2B and G2C applications . Innovators are exploring new ways to apply technologies to address the challenges of social and economic development to build a smart society. Government and Regulators have a responsibility to ensure that the right policy and regulatory frameworks are put in place to allow these applications to flourish, encourage innovation, and stimulate investment in the economy. With this objective in mind, the Authority has come out with this consultation paper (CP) on suo-motu basis to encourage the innovations and identify the policy challenges in adoption of these emerging technologies. II. Status of 5G launches and subscriptions worldwide 1.6 According to a recent report released by GSA in January 2023, i. 515 operators in 155 countries/territories have been investing in 5G networks in the form of tests, pilots, licence acquisitions, planned and actual deployments. 5 ii. Of those, 243 operators in 96 countries/territories have launched commercial 3GPP-compatible 5G services (mobile or fixed wireless access) iii. 112 operators are identified as investing in 5G standalone for public networks (including those evaluating, testing, piloting, plan ning or deploying as well as those that have launched 5G standalone networks). iv. More than 1700 5G devices have been announced, out of which at least 1400 5G devices are commercially available. v. 28 more countries and territories are planning 5G spectrum assignments by the end of 2023. This includes 112 operators that offer 5G fixed wireless access (FWA) services. vi. A GSMA intelligence report predicts that global 5G connections will cross 2billion mark by the end of 2025 (Figure 1.1) Figure 1.1 : Global 5G connections by 2025 Source: GSMA Intelligence *Australia, Japan, Singapore and South Korea 1.7 5G has become mainstream in many pioneer markets (notably China, South Korea and the US) and is making considerable progress in other countries as well.

A new wave of 5G rollouts in large markets with modest income levels (such as Brazil, Indonesia and Ind ia) could further 6 incentivise the mass production of more affordable 5G devices to cater to consumers in lower-income brackets. It could also drive the development of new 5G applications for consumers and enterprises in emerging markets. This is significan t as the majority of 5G applications and use cases to date have been focused on more advanced markets. 1.8 Operators around the world began their 5G deployment efforts with the non-standalone (NSA) version of the technology. However, after a slow start, 5G standalone (SA) deployments are beginning to ramp up. As per a GSA report3, 112 operators in 52 countries and territories are investing in standalone 5G for public networks in the form of trials, plans, paying for licences, deploying or operating networks. At least 37 operators in 22 countries and territories are now understood to have launched public standalone 5G networks, with several more expected to go live in the coming years. The added functionalities enabled by 5G SA are key to delivering on the 5G p romise of fully supporting enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), ultra -reliable low -latency communications (URLLC) and massive IoT use cases. 1.9 Mobile operators are collaborating with vendors and enterprises across different verticals to explore the potential of 5G SA. For example, SoftBank and Honda are working together to test the effectiveness of using 5G SA and a cellular vehicle -to-everything (C-V2X) system to reduce collisions between pedestrians and vehicles. In Spain, Telef ónica has announced plans to target three enterprise 5G use cases for its 5G SA network in 2022 - automated guided robot vehicles for use in places such as warehouses; remote maintenance systems using technology such as smart glasses; and drones for site surveillance. III. 5G deployment in India: 3 GSA-Evolution from LTE to 5G January 23 7 1.10 5G services were first launched in India on October 1, 2022. At present, only Bharti Airtel and Reliance Jio are the two telecom operators offering 5G services in the country. Indian telecom operators have surpassed the three -year 5G network rollout target given to them within six months. They have set up more than 3 lakh sites as of August 2023. It is expected that majority of the towns in the country will be covered by the end of this year. 1.11 India is witnessing a digital revolution since last decade. Rising disposable income coupled with affordable data tariffs are encouraging the people to go digital. Growing smartphone penetration, significant rise in OTT consumption, digital payments, E-commerce are some of the major factors driving this digitization. These drivers enabled the ARPU in India to see a notable rise in the past 4 years, growing at a CAGR of ~ 21% (figure 1.2). This is expected to further see a healthy rise going forward with the advent of 5G that makes data consumption seamless. Figure 1.2: Monthly Wireless ARPU during past 4 years Source: TRAI QPIR 1.12 With this revenue growth trajectory, telecom companies are investing heavily in 5G, fiber and coverage infrastructure across the country. 5G 78.65 101.65 114.16 141.14 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 Q.E.

Government’s Initiative to facilitate the launch of 5G services 1.14 The initiatives by the Government cover a range of factors from building 5G infrastructure and bringing the ecosystem together for effective R&D to helping TSPs to increase investments in 5G. i. 5G HIGH LEVEL FORUM - This forum was formed to provide an action plan to realise the 5G vision. The forum release d a report outlining the roadmap, suggesting policies, programs, standards and use cases for 5G. ii. BHARAT NET - It is government run project that aims to connect the rural India on the optical fibre network and provide it on non -discriminatory basis to all service providers. iii. 5G TEST BED - The government has offered indigenous 5G test bed at free of cost to start-ups and MSMEs and at nominal rates to other stakeholders to validate their use cases. iv. VEPP PROGRAM - 5G Vertical Engagement and Partnership Program (VEPP) is an initiative to build strong collaboration partnerships across 5G 4 https://www.speedtest.net/global-index/india 5 indbiz.gov.in accessed on 2nd March 2023 9 Use-case ecosystem stakeholders with an exclusive emphasis to address User/Vertical Industry needs. In order to multiply the 5G opportunities across the usage verticals, an Inter -Ministerial Committee is constituted with representatives from various Ministries to facilitate collaborative efforts across stakeholders. VEPP will enable close collaboration between User verticals and 5G Tech stakeholders (Service providers, Solution providers & partner OEMs), which can trigger a multiplier effect to try & fine tune 5G digital solutions in respective economic verticals. IV. Likely Impact of 5G and associated technologies on Global Economy 1.15 Various studies show that mobile infrastructure continues to have a stable impact on the world economy. The economic dividend of mobile broadband continues to be greater in countries with lower levels of economic development. 5G’s faster speed, lower latency, and ability to connect huge numbers of devices than previous generations of mobile technology will certainly result in a more efficient and productive society. There are numerous innovative and promising use cases of the technology for various sectors, e.g., hospitals equipped with 5G devices that enable remote patient monitoring, and smart ambulances that communicate with doctors in real time; digital wallets that connect phones, wearables, autonomous connected cars and other devices to create seamless financial transactions; and 5G -enabled factories in which connections can be maintained among more sensors than ever before. 1.16 Moreover, when 5G is used along with AI, extended reality (XR), edge computing and the Internet of Things (IoT), it will enable bu siness and society to realise the full benefits of these other technological advances. 10 Figure 1.3: Economic and social value of 5G6 Source: IHS Markit, The 5G Economy According to a whitepaper released by World Economic Forum (WEF), 5G will be a catalyst for socio -economic growth in the Fourth Industrial Revolution with an estimated $13.2 trillion of global economic value reached by 2035 (See Fig 1.3). 1.17 5G is expected to benefit the global economy by more than $1.5 trillion in 2030 (See Fig 1.4) , initially mostly in developed regions, including East Asia and the Pacific, North America, and Europe. Towards the end of the decade, other regions will also start benefiting from 5G. 5G is expected to benefit all economic sectors of the global economy, although some industries will benefit more than others due to their ability to incorporate 5G use cases in their business. 6 Based on IHS Markit, The 5G Economy: How 5G will contribute to the global economy, 2019. 11 Figure 1.4: Annual global 5G contribution by industry, 2030 Source : NASSCOM Arthur D Little 5G Report Nov2022 V.

Sectors such as healthcare, energy & utilities, manufacturing, and retail are expected to benefit the most from large-scale 5G adoption. Effective collaboration between public and private players for creating a skilled workforce and cybersecurity infrastructure, reducing regulatory overlaps, and providing financial incentives, will be needed to ensure that the benefits of 5G are realised across sectors. 5G along with the associated technologies is expected to 7 NASSCOM Arthur D Little 5G Report Nov2022 Energy &Utilities 21.6% Retail 14.4%Healthcare 34.6% Manufacturing 8.8% BFSI 5.6% Automotive 5.3% Agriculture 0.7% Public Safety& Transport 6.8% Media & Entertainment 2.2% $1.5 Tn 12 create new value through hyper -connectivity and become a catalyst for digital transformation across industries. Figure 1.5: 5G Contribution for select Industries in India 2030 1.19 These technologies are not only transforming India's digital landscape but also creating synergies among them. For example, 5G can provide the backbone for IoT and AI applications that require high bandwidth and low latency. IoT and AI can generate and ana lyze huge amounts of data that can be used to create immersive and personalized experiences in the metaverse. Metaverse can offer a platform for showcasing and monetizing the innovations and solutions enabled by 5G, IoT and AI. India has a unique opportuni ty to leverage its strengths in digital infrastructure, talent pool, entrepreneurial ecosystem to become a global leader in digital transformation. By harnessing the potential of 5G, IoT, AI and metaverse, India can accelerate its economic growth, social d evelopment and global competitiveness. Energy &Utilities 30% Retail 20%Healthcare 15% Manufacturing 10% BFSI 8% Automotive 7% Agriculture 5% Logistics 3% Media & Entertainment 2% $180 Bn 13 1.20 However, achieving this will require effective ecosystem collaboration between TSPs, OEMs, Infrastructure providers, and the Government to increase consumer adoption and market readiness to unlock large -scale benefits of 5G. Adequate infrastructure upgradation and fiberisation for 5G deployment, along with network densification need to be addressed to realise the full benefit of the technology across industries. 5G adoption will depend on factors such as dedicated R&D investments to develop India-specific use cases, enterprise penetration, device affordability, and consumer adoption. VI. Collaboration based approach for 5G use cases and Ecosystem 1.21 Telecom industry has been transitioning from different generations of mobile technologies since last few decades and has been pivoting from voice to content to commerce and industrial applications. 5G technology holds the potential to enable unprecedented degrees of flexibility, productivity, and efficiency in various indust ry verticals. The potential of 5G, combined with artificial intelligence (AI), AR/VR, smart platforms and IoT, can deliver enormous value to consumers, organizations and the society at large. It will also pave the way for developing services for making smart cities, autonomous vehicles, smart factories, etc. However, to realise the true potential of 5G, the ICT industry must come together as an ecosystem for development and deployment of mature use cases. 1.22 The core competency of TSPs today is in providing ne twork connectivity. To realise the potential benefits of 5G, the network needs to transform into a digital platform and be delivered as a service in the digital marketplace. Most of the implementations of 5G use cases will be brownfield implementations where the 5G solution needs to seamlessly integrate with existing business processes, IT systems and operational technologies. TSPs will need to adopt an ecosystem and build trusted and strategic partnerships with other ecosystem players for faster and mass -scale adoption of 5G use cases. Mobile operators across the globe are 14 collaborating with vendors and enterprises across different verticals to develop and deploy 5G use cases for industry. Chapter 2 of this consultation paper deliberates on need of such collaborations in India for development and deployment of 5G use cases. VII.

Associated Emerging Technologies shaping the Digital Economy 1.23 The use cases and economic benefits discussed in the previous sections cannot be realised with the help of 5G technology alone. Looking at 5G in isolation will make it difficult to understand why this new mobile generation is receiving so much attention. T o fully understand the strength of the 5G disruption or inflection point, it is relevant to understand the associated technologies (Figure 1.7) that co -create the strong market momentum. Figure 1.6: Technologies driving the 5G market momentum.8 8 Source : https://www.ericsson.com/en/blog/2021/9/5g-practitioners-guide-2021-episode2 15 The combined forces of edge computing, IoT, AI, and XR make it even more exciting. These technologies represent a strong cluster together with other technologies piggybacking on them. We can expect the next generation of use cases shaping the digital econo my to rely on a combination of these technologies. They have been elaborated further in the following sections. A. Edge Computing 1.24 Edge computing is the logical evolution of the cloud computing model. It is a paradigm that brings computation and data storage closer to the location where it is needed, to improve response times and save bandwidth. The use of edge devices that store and process data locally, rather than relying on centralized data centre or more traditional cloud computing, enables faster decision making. Additionally, real -time processing at the edge makes data more relevant and actionable, helping to deliver better customer outcomes. Enterprises are beginning to develop use cases combining cloud based IoT solutions with edge computing, powered by the increasing availability of superfast 5G internet connectivity, to accelerate data analysis to make better and faster decisions. 1.25 However, edge computing also poses several challenges and issues that need t o be addressed by researchers, practitioners, and policymakers. Edge devices and networks have limited resources such as processing power, memory, storage, battery, and bandwidth. Efficient allocation and management of these resources are required to meet the diverse and dynamic demands of edge computing applications. Edge devices and networks may be more vulnerable to cyberattacks and data breaches than centralized cloud systems. The issue has been dealt with in Chapter 3 of this CP in more detail. 1.26 The exp onential growth of consumer applications in 5G era and their dependency on edge data centres will create a steep rise in the demand of 16 power consumption in data centres. A report by McKinsey suggests that data centres are responsible for over two percent o f global electricity consumption, which is increasing year on year. 9 Today, rising carbon emissions from data centres are predicted to exceed those of the airline industry. Data centres also pose other environmental impacts beyond energy use and greenhous e gas emissions, such as water use and the generation of electronic waste. Considering the increasing environmental concerns, especially in a power frugal country like India, operating data centres with green and renewable energy and smarter and more efficient cooling system is necessary. There is a need to implement policy measures to encourage more energy-efficient greener data centres for sustainable 5G deployment. The issue has been deliberated in detail in Chapter 3 of this CP. B. Artificial Intelligence 1.27 Artificial Intelligence (AI) is enabling rapid innovation with many potential benefits for society and business. AI is likely to be a big game changer in transforming business and society. According to a PWC study, AI could contribute up to $15.7 trillion10 to the global economy in 2030, more than the current output of China and India combined. As the adoption of AI accelerates, organisations and governments around the world are considering how best to harness this technology for the benefit of people and the planet. AI has the potential to truly change the world, and this represents not only an opportunity but also a risk. AI depends on large amounts of data, often relating to individuals, and makes inferences based on this data. These inferences may be used to guide decisions that have a significant impact on the things people care about the most – their health, their employment and their access to resources.",

    "text": "enabling rapid innovation with many potential benefits for society and business. AI is likely to be a big game changer in transforming business and society. According to a PWC study, AI could contribute up to $15.7 trillion10 to the global economy in 2030, more than the current output of China and India combined. As the adoption of AI accelerates, organisations and governments around the world are considering how best to harness this technology for the benefit of people and the planet. AI has the potential to truly change the world, and this represents not only an opportunity but also a risk. AI depends on large amounts of data, often relating to individuals, and makes inferences based on this data. These inferences may be used to guide decisions that have a significant impact on the things people care about the most – their health, their employment and their access to resources. 9 Data Centres turn to green energy to power new facilities, CIO News, ET CIO (indiatimes.com) 10https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/issues/data-and-analytics/publications/artificial-intelligence- study.html 17 1.28 It is therefore necessary that AI is used in a way that protects our fundamental human rights. Citizens need to be confident that AI is being developed and used in an ethical and trustworthy manner. This is a rapidly evolving space, and many governments are in the process of drafting regulations relating to AI. In view of this and upon rec eiving a reference from DoT, TRAI had initiated a consultation on the subject and has come out with its recommendations dated 20th July 2023 on “Leveraging Artificial Intelligence and Big Data in Telecommunication Sector”, wherein it has been recommended that for ensuring development of responsible Artificial Intelligence (AI) in India, there is an urgent need to adopt a regulatory framework by the Government that should be applicable across sectors. The regulatory framework should ensure that specific AI use cases are regulated on a risk-based framework where high risk use cases that directly impact humans are regulated through legally binding obligations. Further, the Authority also recommended the broad tenets of the suggested regulatory framework for AI. C. Internet of Things (IoT) 1.29 The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the network of physical devices, sensors, and software that collect and exchange data over the internet. Together, 5G and IoT can enable a variety of use cases that can benefit different sectors and industries, such as smart cities, healthcare, manufacturing, agriculture, and transportation. Some of these industry vertical use cases are mentioned below. i. 5G can support the deployment of millions of IoT devices that can monitor and manage various aspects of urban life, such as traffic, pollution, energy, waste, security, and public services. This can improve the efficiency, sustainability, and liveability of cities. ii. 5G can enable remote monitoring and diagnosis of patients using wearable IoT devices and sensors that can transmit vital signs and medical data in 18 real time. This can reduce the need for hospital visits and improve the quality and accessibility of healthcare services. iii. It can also facilitate the automation and optimization of industrial processes using IoT devices that can communicate and coordinate with each other. This can increase productivity, quality, safety, and flexibility of manufacturing operations. iv. 5G can enable precision farming using IoT devices that can collect and analyze data on soil, weather, crops, and livestock. This can help farmers optimize their inputs, outputs, and practices to increase yield and reduce environmental impact. v. 5G can enable connected and autonomous vehicles that can communicate with each other and with the infrastructure to optimize traffic flow, reduce accidents, and enhance mobility. IoT Challenges and Need for Consultation 1.30 However, 5G enabled IoT also poses some challenges and risks that need to be addressed and regulated. 5G enabled IoT devices can be vulnerable to cyberattacks that can compromise their functionality, data integrity, and privacy. This can have serious conse quences for critical infrastructure, public safety, and personal information. 5G enabled IoT devices can collect and process large amounts of personal and sensitive data that can reveal user behaviour, preferences, location, and identity. This can raise ethical and legal issues regarding data ownership, consent, access, and protection. 1.31 There is immense scope of development of 5G enabled IOT use cases across various industry verticals. Such use cases have a potential to alter the traditional methods of farmi ng, manufacturing in micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs). However, such innovations and uptake of 5G enabled IOT based applications require awareness and skill development in the corresponding sectors. A concerted effort towards skill 19 development and awareness will go a long a way in promoting innovations and realization of potential of 5G enabled IoT use cases in rural / MSME sectors. 1.32 As discussed above, 5G enabled IoT use cases involve multiple stakeholders across different sectors and jurisdictio",

This can create challenges for interoperability, compliance, accountability, and governance. Therefore, 5G enabled IoT use cases offer significant benefits for various domains but also requir e careful regulation to address the potential challenges and risks. A balanced approach that considers the technical, social, economic, and ethical aspects of 5G enabled IoT is needed to ensure its responsible and sustainable development and deployment. Chapter 3 of this consultation paper deals with all these aspects related to IoT. D. Metaverse (Augmented / Virtual / Mixed Reality (AR/VR/MR)) 1.33 The metaverse is a term that refers to a virtual reality space where users can interact with a computer -generated environment and other users. It is often seen as the next evolution of the internet, where social connection, work, education, entertainment, and commerce can take place in immersive digital spaces. It creates an immersive space for interactions that are enabled by a range of technologies—including, but not limited to augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), Mixed reality (XR), artificial intelligence (AI), internet of things, and digital twins. It has the potential of creating a simulated real-life environment where people can talk, work, and play using specialized glasses, headsets, controllers, and related resources. The Metaverse is curr ently all the rage in the digital world because of its seemingly endless potential and objectives. Metaverse Challenges and Need for Consultation 20 1.34 Industry players and investors are overwhelmingly looking for new use cases and monetisation opportunities from metaverse. Some estimates suggest that the metaverse market could be worth up to US$13 trillion by 203011. The size of the metaverse will make it hard to ignore and denotes its influence over the way people will live, work and play. Many things that people do today on the internet, may soon be done in the metaverse instead. When any market receives investment in millions of dollars of hard-earned money, legal and regulatory frameworks become a necessity to ensure a degree of ethics, trust , and diligence. Ensuring trust and transparency in metaverse is essential to instil confidence among the consumers for its adoption. If appropriate and timely steps are not taken today for forging trust and safety for the digital spaces where we live, work and play, the next generations may inherit a digital world polluted by predators, hate speech and mistrust. Hence, it is important that the regulators across the world get on board sooner and put in place necessary guidance or frameworks fit for metavers e. Then only its benefits will be visible across the economies and societies. Chapter 4 of this consultation paper delves into the requirement of a regulatory framework for Metaverse in India. E. Robotics 1.35 Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, IoT and Robotics are working together and creating wonders for solving the problems of mankind and humanity. With massive and low -latency connectivity, 5G can revolutionize the robotics industry. It will pave the way for a new generation of robots, controlled via wireless rather than wired communications links and exploiting the vast computing and data storage resources of the edge cloud. Armed with these capabilities, robots can be 11 https://www.precedenceresearch.com/metaverse-market 21 precisely controlled dynamically in near real time and be connected to people and machines locally and globally. In short, 5G will fully enable applications such as the “factory of the future” and many, m any others that were previously beyond the capabilities of both cellular and robotics technologies. 1.36 Some of these use cases are discussed below. i. Robots are already ubiquitous in manufacturing, of which the auto industry is perhaps the most obvious example. They can carry out a large number of tasks in the manufacturing process, allowing their human counterparts to be employed in other areas. This enhances safety – particularly where dangerous chemicals are involved. ii. 5G-equipped robots could help fee d the world’s ever -growing population through advances in",

This enhances safety – particularly where dangerous chemicals are involved. ii. 5G-equipped robots could help fee d the world’s ever -growing population through advances in agriculture. The “untethering” of robots via 5G and GPS-based geolocation will allow them to perform functions that are impossible today. Robotic farm equipment could drastically cut the amount of labour needed to grow crops. All of these can be attributed to the power of 5G, which provides a constant flow of real -time data on soil conditions, pests, and weeds for the robots to analyse, calculate, and execute. iii. Autonomous vehicles hitting the streets in near future too will be robots on wheels, executing instructions from a vast array of sensors to make decisions and perform functions, presumably a lot more accurately, reliably, and faster than humans. Gyrocopters and other unmanned vehicles also fit in this category. iv. Healthcare is another sector where robotics has immense potential. The robots will not only perform functions such as transferring things from one place to another in a hospital, aided by 5G communications and the cloud, but they will also enable telesurgery in which operations are orchestrated remotely by doctors and performed locally by robots. 22 v. In agriculture, robots could wander through fields monitoring growing conditions and sending video and other sensor information back to a computer located virtually anywhere, or even perform activities such as spraying, pruning, and harvesting. A company called FFRobotics 12 has developed what it calls a fresh fruit robotics harvester that combines robotic controls with image processing software algorithms that allow it to find and distinguish between saleable and damaged produce as well as between fruit that is either not yet ripe or dead. 1.37 5G-enabled robotic technologies have the potential to transform industries and improve the quality of life for people around the world. However, the successful deployment of these technologies requires regulators and policymakers to address a range of chal lenges, including cybersecurity, privacy, safety, and workforce development. By proactively addressing these challenges and working collaboratively with industry stakeholders and international partners, policymakers can help ensure that the benefits of 5G-enabled robotic technologies are realized in a safe, responsible, and equitable manner. F. Drones 1.38 Drones, also known as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), are increasingly becoming an essential technology for various industries worldwide. From agriculture to logistics and disaster management to surveillance, drones are being integrated into numerous sect ors for improved efficiency and cost-effectiveness. With the advent of 5G networks, the potential for drones to revolutionize the way we live and work is immense. However, the widespread adoption of drones also brings forth several policy challenges. In the Indian context, where the drone market is experiencing significant 12 https://www.mouser.in/applications/robotics-and-5g/ 23 growth, addressing these challenges is crucial to harness the benefits of UAVs. 1.39 Drones hold immense potential for transforming various sectors in India, with some of the most significant applications being13,14: i. Agriculture: Drones can be utilized for crop monitoring, pest management, and precision agriculture practices, which can help increase crop yield and reduce input costs for Indian farmers. ii. Disaster Management: India is prone to various natural disasters, such as floods, cyclones, and earthquakes. Drones can play a critical role in disaster management by providing real -time aerial imagery, assessing damage, and assisting in search and rescue operations. iii. Infrastructure Monitoring: Drones can be used to monitor and inspect critical infrastructure, such as roads, bridges, and power lines, ensuring timely maintenance and reducing the risk of accidents. iv. Healthcare: In remote and inaccessible areas, drones can be utilized for the rapid delivery of medical supplies and vaccines, significantly improving healthcare services for rural populations. v. Military: Drones can be used to provide air support to ground troops, targeting enemy positions with precision-guided munitions. VIII.

Simultaneously, the Indian government has embraced the use of information technology for delivering numerous e- Governance projects in the last two decades. These include two types of projects, one where government -owned non -personal data is created 13 “Use Drones to Monitor Infrastructure Projects: PM Narendra Modi.” The Economic Times, 2 May 2017, https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/use-drones-to- monitor-infrastructure-projects-pm-narendra-modi/articleshow/58471207.cms. 14 Santhanam, Vignesh. “How Drones Could Change the Future of Healthcare Delivery.” World Economic Forum, 8 May 2020, https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/05/medical-drone- delivery-india-africa-modernize-last-mile/. 24 based on anonymising interactions with Indian citizens, and the second type involving purely non-personal data processing that does not involve any individuals at any stage. The latter may include weather, traffic, military, scientific, commercial and economic research data processed by the government in a digital medium. 1.41 Data is a valuable economic and social resour ce offering enormous opportunities for citizens, businesses, and governments. With increasing digitization and engagement, the volume of data is also increasing exponentially, providing opportunities for better governance, service delivery and innovation in sectors critical for societal transformation. Data processed across various sectors thus presents enormous economic potential. India data monetization is projected to grow at a CAGR of 7.68% to attain a market size of US$5.725 billion by 2027, from US$3.411 billion in 2020.15 If India wants to fulfil its ambition of achieving a $5 trillion economy, it must develop the capability of harnessing the value of data. Challenges and Need for Consultation 1.42 Government and the Authority has taken several initiatives to ensure protection of users’ data. “Digital Personal Data Protection Bill, 2023”, was passed by the parliament on 9th August 202316 and Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 came into effect from 11th August 2023. In May 2022, the govern ment has published the draft ‘ National Data Governance Framework Policy ( NDGFP), which p romises to ensure that any anonymized data and non -personal data from both the private or government entities can be accessed by the 'research and innovation eco- system', in a safe and accessible manner. The objective of this policy is to derive economic value from its data, following the National Data Sharing and Accessibility Policy notified in 2012. It is important to define what type 15 https://www.knowledge-sourcing.com/report/india-data-monetization-market 16 https://pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID=1947264 25 of data can be monetized and how it can be used. If it is something that is completely non -personal such as data related to climate or some geospatial information, then there are fewer concerns, but when it gets linked to individuals, a large part of the concern comes up. These concerns have been dealt with in Chapter 5 of this consultation paper. Structure of the Consultation Paper 1.43 The Consultation Paper (CP) comprises of six chapters. This chapter introduces the subject and sets the context for present consultation. Chapter 2 of the CP raises concerns about the need of ecosystem or collaboration-based approach for development and deployment of 5G use cases. Chapter 3 discusses the issues relating to adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) use cases. Chapter 4 of this paper delves into the benefits and regulatory challenges posed by the Metaverse. Chapter 5 deals with the issues related to digitisation, monetization and sharing of data and finally Chapter 6 summarizes the various issues for consultation. 26 Chapter – 2 ECOSYSTEM FOR 5G USE CASES I. Evolution of Mobile Technologies 2.1. The evolution of mobile technologies has been driven by the continuous \"chase\" for higher data rates, higher capacity, lower delay, better spectrum efficiency and flexibility, high level of QoS provisioning, diversified mobile speed and greater coverage over cellular . It resulted in GPRS/EDGE (2.5/2.75G) evolving to UMTS (3G) to HSPA (3.5G) to HSPA+ (3.75G), then to 4G LTE, LTE -Advanced and LTE -Advanced Pro, finally evolving to 5G NR, and continuing further to 5G -Advanced and later (around 2030) to 6G. From 3G onwards, the ITU makes umbrella specifications for Network, devices and services for a part icular generation of mobile technology , called IMT.

Figure 2.1 IMT-Family and naming conventions (source: ITU) Figure 1.1 shows ITU umbrella specifications for 3G (IMT-2000), 4G (IMT- Advanced) and 5G (IMT-2020), and technologies that were accepted by the 27 ITU under each such umbrella. Each such umbrella included stricter requirements than the previous, thus ensuring continuous progress in mobile systems. 2.2. The enhancements in key capabilities from IMT-Advanced to IMT-2020 is shown in figure 1.2. For example , IMT-2020 can deliver minimum peak bitrate of 20 Gbit/s in downlink, and 10 Gbit/s in uplink. Bitrates experienced by individual mobile users are to be 100 Mbit/s or higher. Also, connection density in IMT-2020 is increased ten times as compared to IMT-Advanced, which is set to support minimum 1 million connections per square kilometer in 5G systems. This includes smartphones, IoT devices, and all other IMT -2020/5G devices. Another important enhancement is support for user plane latency as low as 1 ms, whi ch is needed for the envisioned critical services in IMT-2020 (i.e., 5G) systems. Figure 2.2: Enhancements from IMT-Advanced to IMT-2020 Source: ITU 2.3. To have a much better understanding, these enhancements are also presented in tabular form. 28 Table 2.1: IMT-2020 vs. IMT-Advanced by ITU (source: ITU) IMT-Advanced IMT-2020 Minimum peak bitrate Downlink: 1 Gbit/s Uplink: 0.05 Gbit/s Downlink: 20 Gbit/s Uplink: 10 Gbit/s Bitrate experienced by individual mobile device 10 Mbit/s 100 Mbit/s Peak spectral efficiency Downlink:15bit/s/Hz Uplink: 6.75 bit/s/Hz Downlink:30bit/s/Hz Uplink: 15 bit/s/Hz Mobility 350 km/h 500 km/h User plane latency 10 msec 1 msec Connection density 100 thousand devices per square kilometer 1million devices per square kilometer Traffic capacity 0.1 Mbit/s/sq. m. 10 Mbit/s/sq. m. in hot spots 2.4. The deployment of 5G is happening in two modes, i.e. 5G Non-Stand- Alone (NSA) architecture and 5G Stand -Alone architecture. According to 3GPP, the 5G NSA architecture will have 5G RAN, 5G New Radio (NR), and 4G LTE access and network core. On the other side, the 5G SA architecture is characterized by dedicated 5G RAN base stations, small cell base stations, and a 5G core (5GC) network. While the NSA architecture only supports LTE services but has improved 5G capabilities such as lower latency as well as higher bitrates. SA architecture can take full advantage of 5G end-to-end network capabilities supported by NR and 5GC, providing customized service, especially to vertical industry, in an effective and efficient way. New features, including service -based architecture, end -to-end network slicing, and MEC (Multi -access Edge Computing), can be enabled according to specific requirement of each 29 service, providing customized superior 5G user experience. These features are discussed in detail in the following section. II. 5G and Beyond 2.5. The 5G New Radio (NR) and 5G Core (5GC) evolution is continuing in 3GPP toward 5G Advanced, to ensure the success of 5G systems globally and to expand the usage of 3GPP technology by supporting different use cases and verticals. AI/ML will play an important role in 5G Advanced systems, in addition to other t echnology components, to provide support for extended reality (XR), reduced capability (RedCap) devices, and network energy efficiency. 5G and beyond networks are expected to ensure better quality of service, very high data rate, improved network security, high capacity, low latency, and low cost. In order to meet these objectives, several key enabler technologies have been proposed including massive multiple input multiple output, small cells, multi-access edge computing, software defined network, heterogeneous networks, network slicing, cloud radio access network, ultra -dense network, energy efficiency, and spectrum sharing. 2.6. The next generation mobile technology i.e. , sixth generation or 6G technology, currently under development, is anticipated to make several major leaps forward. It is expected to become available in 2030 providing truly omnipresent wireless intelligence. W ith speeds almost 100 times faster than 5G, it will enhance and drive new communication applications. These technological advances will impact user experience and transform economies and lives everywhere.

In India, The Department of Telecommunications constituted a Technology Innovation Group on 6G (TIG-6G) on 1st November 2021 with members from various Ministries/Departments, research and development institutions, academia, standardization bodies, Telecom Service Providers and industry to develop Vision, Mission and Goals for the 6G and also develop a roadmap and action plans for 6G in India. The TIG-6G in turn constituted six Task Forces with industry, academia, R&D institutions and Government as members on Multi -Disciplinary Innovative Solutions, Multiplatform Next Generation Networks, Spectrum for Next Generat ion Requirements, Devices, International Standards Contribution and Funding Research and Development. 2.8. Based on the reports of the Six Task Forces, a Bharat 6G Vision Document has been prepared by the Technology Innovation Group on 6G. The Vision for 6G is fully aligned with the national Vision of Atmanirbhar Bharat and will seek to empower every Indian to become Atmanirbhar (self-reliant) in their lives. The research and start -up ecosystem will be tapped to bring innovations and new ideas to the table. Adeq uate provisions for financial support will be made available. The Mission will be completed in two phases - Phase 1 from 2023-2025 (2 years) and Phase 2 from 2025 -2030 (5 years). 2.9. The objectives of Bharat 6G Mission is to i. Facilitate and finance Research and Development, design and development of 6G technologies by Indian Startups/Companies/Research bodies/Universities; ii. Enable India to become a leading global supplier of IP, products and solutions of affordable 6G telecom solutions; iii. Deploy 6G tech nologies to act as a powerful force multiplier for India@2030; 31 iv. Enable inclusive and significant enhancement in the quality of living experience of citizens in India and across the world. III. 5G Special Features 2.10. The ITU has defined three standard 5G service profiles – Massive Machine to Machine -Type Communications (mMTC), Ultra -Reliable Low -Latency Communications (uRLLC) and Enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB). These profiles are expected to meet the requirements of mos t industrial applications and are driving the adoption of 5G for industrial use cases. i. Massive Machine to Machine -Type Communications (mMTC ): Providing connectivity to IoT devices and machines on a large scale with connection density of 1 million devices per square km. mMTC supports extremely high connection densities, enabling industrial-scale IoT. ii. Ultra-reliable low-latency communication ( uRLLC): With uRLLC, 5G will be able to connect controllers, switches, sensors, and actuators at latency and reliability levels equivalent to those of a wired connection. 5G’s URLLC service profile addresses several critical applications in different industries and scenarios, such as for manufacturing, automation, and autonomous equipment or vehicle operation. iii. Enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB): Very High Speed broadband on Cellular Network with data rates of the order of 20 bps. The special features that enable 5G to meet the requirement of these service profiles are discussed below: A. Service Based Architecture 2.11. Compared to previous generations the 3GPP 5G system architecture is service based. That means wherever suitable the architectural elements are defined as network functions that offer their services via interfaces of a common framework to any network functions that are permitted to make use of these provided services. This architectural m odel, which further adopts principles like modularity, reusability and self -containment of 32 network functions, is chosen to enable deployments to take advantage of the latest virtualization and software technologies. 2.12. The service-based architecture (SBA) provides capability exposure by making 5G Core Network functionalities available to third parties such as service providers and vertical industries outside the operator’s domain. This feature is provided by the Network Exposure Function (NEF) . The interface provided by the NEF to third parties can be regarded as one of the essential membranes through which 5G communicates more closely with vertical industries than",

That means wherever suitable the architectural elements are defined as network functions that offer their services via interfaces of a common framework to any network functions that are permitted to make use of these provided services. This architectural m odel, which further adopts principles like modularity, reusability and self -containment of 32 network functions, is chosen to enable deployments to take advantage of the latest virtualization and software technologies. 2.12. The service-based architecture (SBA) provides capability exposure by making 5G Core Network functionalities available to third parties such as service providers and vertical industries outside the operator’s domain. This feature is provided by the Network Exposure Function (NEF) . The interface provided by the NEF to third parties can be regarded as one of the essential membranes through which 5G communicates more closely with vertical industries than mobile networks of earlier generations did. 5G service exposure by the NEF is based on so-called RESTful APIs. 2.13. The Network Functions (NFs) forming the SBA communicates with each other via Service Based Interfaces (SBI). So, this way the 5G Core Network internal communication obeys the same principles as the functional exposure, thus allowing a harmonized and holistic technological approach of the complete 5G system . This is fully in -line with the progressive paradigms which are at the heart of a wide range of services used by end- customers as well as for the automation of whole industries. B. Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) 2.14. Multi-access edge computing (MEC) enables telecom operators and third- party service provider’s content and functions to be hosted close to User Equipment's (UE) access point of attachment. MEC brings significant reduction in end -to-end latency and load on transport network. Unified MEC in IMT-2020 networks is like Platform As A Service (PAAS) functions to ensure the quick integration of storage, computing, network and security capabilities, and to build up an ecosystem for operat or's and third-party's services and applications. An MEC application runs on top of the virtualization infrastructure and can interact with the MEC platform to provide and deploy MEC services. 33 2.15. The 5G network will enable a variety of services, including enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) based services, massive machine type communications (mMTC) based services and ultra -reliable low latency communications (URLLC) based services. Therefore, mobile edge cloud in 5G network is required to be very eff icient, personalized, intelligent, reliable and flexible. MEC involves multiple actors, such as network operators, service providers, application developers, and end -users. Stakeholders need to ensure interoperability and compatibility among different MEC platforms, services, and applications, as well as alignment with existing and emerging standards and regulations . MEC involves dynamic allocation and optimization of resources, such as computing, storage, bandwidth, and energy, at the edge of the network. Stakeholders need to define the resource management and orchestration strategies, algorithms, and tools for MEC applications and services. 2.16. However, the most significant challenge posed by MEC that needs to be addressed by researchers, practitioners, and policymakers is the security and privacy. MEC is more vulnerable to cyberattacks and data breaches than centralized cloud systems. MEC involves processing and storing data at the edge of the network, which may raise concerns about data protection, confidentiality, and integrity. Another challenge is minimizing the energy consumption and environmental footprint of MEC. Stakeholders need to suggest policies and mechanisms for overcoming these challenges related to MEC. All these issues have been deliberated in detail in Chapter 3. C. Network Slicing 2.17. 5G network will enable a variety of services, including enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB) services, massive Machine Type Communications (mMTC) based services and Ultra -Reliable Low Latency Communications (URLLC), on the same infrastructure of network and computing resources. 34 Network operators have traditionally provisioned multiple different networks to cope with different requirements in terms of service characteristics, functionalities, and performance. Network slicing enables 5G network operators to create logically partitioned networks providing customized solutions for different market and business scenarios. 2.18. According to the ITU’s definition - network slice is a logical netw ork that provides specific network capabilities and network characteristics. Network slices enable the creation of customized networks to provide flexible solutions for different market scenarios which have diverse requirements, with respect to functionali ties, performance and resource allocation. The behaviour of a network slice is realized via Network Slice Instance(s) (NSIs). A Network Slice Instance (NSI) is composed of a set of Network Function Instances (NFIs) running over the allocated resources. An NSI constitutes a logical network that provides specific network capabilities and characteristics. The underlying physical infrastructure is abstracted as network, storage, or computing resources with the help of network virtualization based on SDN, NFV, a nd cloud computing technologies. 2.19.

The underlying physical infrastructure is abstracted as network, storage, or computing resources with the help of network virtualization based on SDN, NFV, a nd cloud computing technologies. 2.19. There are different possible uses of network slicing in 5G. For example, one network slice can be allocated for mobile Internet traffic from an operator’s own subscriber (via eMBB network slice) and another network slice can be allocated for the similar traffic (i.e., mobile Internet access) for a virtual mobile operator which is using the same 5G network infrastructure. For 5G services that require very low latencies and high reliability, a separate network slice (or slices) can be allocated (e.g., URLLC slices), where different slices can be created for different end customers (e.g., one slice for one enterprise, another network slice for other enterprise, and so on). 35 2.20. SDN, NFV and network slicing also enables offering customized services with different requirements on QoS. During the 5G era, network slicing will allow mobile operators to create virtual data pipelines for each data service. This means that QoS will be assured for every service. It may be noted that this app roach is not jeopardizing the Internet network neutrality, which is also valid in mobile networks, but it is more targeted to extension of mobile services portfolio to other verticals, such as mission critical services, connected cars, industry automation, etc. Ultimately, the technology allows mobile operators to develop unprecedented business models. IV. Use Cases in various Industry Verticals A more elaborate analysis of sector -wise use cases of these emerging technologies is presented below. A. Healthcare 2.21. 5G boosted by advances in robotics, drones, IoT and AI —will enable the emergence of a new, connected healthcare ecosystem. This ecosystem will use 5G connectivity to meet patient and provider needs accurately, conveniently, cost -effectively and at a massive scale. According to PwC study 5G-powered healthcare applications will add US$530bn to global GDP by 2030. 5G could enhance healthcare applications in the following ways: i. Remote Patient Monitoring: Smart wearables with sensors will constantly track patient’s vitals, detect faults in medical devices and relay this information to a cloud platform monitored by doctors to prevent adverse health issues. Medical data collected from almost 1 Mn devices per-sq-Km via 5G will enable Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) where hospitals will function as modern data centers and offer customized consultations for patients rapidly. 36 ii. Telemedicine: Online consultations and digital prescriptions equipped by 5G will bridge the d octor-patient gap and provide secure, quick and enhanced healthcare in rural areas. iii. Remotely operated robotic surgeries, AR/VR assisted medical procedures, robotic aids capable of performing CT scans and remote diagnosis. XR tools will enable immersive visualization and medical training such as using haptic gloves with sensors to learn complex procedures online. iv. Drone enabled medical service delivery: 5G enabled drones can increase speed of delivery of medicines/vaccines, expedite collection of medical samples. Thus, 5G will expand the reach and effectiveness of remote health monitoring and telemedicine programmes in far -flung and rural areas also, which don’t have easy access to hospitals. B. Education 2.22. In the post-pandemic era, the digitalisation of educational landscape has accelerated manifold. Most classrooms have adopted some form of virtual learning, requiring video conferencing and other devices . 5G allows educational delivery to be faster, more reliable, and smoothe r. With 5G, video conferencing platforms will improve in quality and reliability around the globe. Students will be able to download videos and learning materials faster and even have holograms of guest speakers in their classroom without dips or delays. Also, since 5G allows more data to be transferred, communication among peers for group projects will happen faster almost as if people across geographies are sitting in the same room. 2.23. Some skills, such as lab work and hands -on experiences, require extra tactile stimulation to create the same level of learning online as in real life and real -time. Those interested in learning new skills and visualizing abstract concepts in an interactive way can benefit from the integration of AR and VR into immersive classrooms. 5G will provide",

Those interested in learning new skills and visualizing abstract concepts in an interactive way can benefit from the integration of AR and VR into immersive classrooms. 5G will provide a greater network 37 capacity and seamless experience that allows learners to explore complex concepts through zooming, pinching, and even touching. Further, haptic responses (that reproduce the feeling, touch, o r motion of interacting directly with a physical object) could introduce tactile forms of learning to a classroom through traditional video conferencing platforms, making interactions richer. 2.24. It is a general belief that one-size-fits-all approach for education could hinder growth. 5G has the capability to change that . It will improve personalization by creating intelligent systems to understand the unique needs of each student and create targeted learning journeys. For example, virtual teaching assistants could allow cohorts to access different sets of lessons and assessments depending upon the profile and preferences of learners. 2.25. As 5G expands to reach more aspects of daily life, it will make learning on-the-go easier, providing greater responsiveness and speed across all devices, especially mobile. I t can provide the flexibility to busy students and professionals who need to learn outside the classroom. 5G will accelerate the promise of democratizing access to quality education in inclusive and affordable ways, thus providing a level playing field, especially for under-resourced communities. C. Agriculture 2.26. 5G will revolutionise the agriculture sector by realising precision agriculture, achieving best cost realisation, optimising utilisation of crop and livestock resources, smart management and ensuring best price for the end users. 5G enabled drones can be deployed for remote sensing of farms and spraying fertilizers/ pesticides/insecticides. The goals are profitability, safeguarding the environment and sustainability. Precision agriculture is a strategy for enhancing productivity. This strategy increases accuracy and throughput at all levels with reduced cost and 38 labour through automation, remote sensing, data analytics utilising 5G. With the help of 5G enabled IOT devices, data from numerous sources is collected, updated frequently and sent to the cloud in real time. In the cloud, data is analysed using AI/ ML algorithms to present actionable insights to the farmers. The sources may be soil moisture, wea ther, seed genetics, crop condition, plant health, historical yields, soil pH level, crop prices collected from the market etc. The actionable insights can be regarding crop to be planted, type of seed to be sown, timing of plantation, type of fertilizer, quantity and timing of fertilizer application, pests infecting the field, type and amount of crop protection products to apply, Irrigation, harvesting and selling of crops. 2.27. 5G enabled drones, equipped with multispectral sensors, can be used to analyse the nutrient status of crops by Digital soil Mapping. This data is integrated with weather and other agronomic information for applying an optimal quantity of fertilizer precisely at a specified area. Drones scan and detect pests, diseases and weeds and apply pesticides at target areas after the data is analysed by an AI algorithm. 20 per cent of global GHG (Greenhouse Gases) emissions are contributed by agriculture. Soil nutrients are lost due to excessive usage of chemicals. Usage of chemicals can be reduced, without impacting the yield, by deploying 5G powered drones as described above. Drones can collect and deliver information about field status and crop stage. As 5G supports high bandwidth, the 5G enabled drones can collect high resolution quality video da ta and relay it faster. 2.28. Autonomous agricultural vehicles are another use case in agriculture. Farmers can monitor tractor's status from their cell phone which provides images and live data of the tractor. Tractors can be fitted with 5G enabled devices which allow operators to adjust remotely tractor's speed, depth of soil penetration and distance between seed rows. Driverless farm equipment will provide more flexibility and efficiency and save labour cost. 39 2.29. Another use case in farming can be Livestock moni toring and management. India has highest cattle population with more than 30 0 million17 cattle and is the country with the largest consumption of dairy products. But our cattle productivity is less with daily milk",

India has highest cattle population with more than 30 0 million17 cattle and is the country with the largest consumption of dairy products. But our cattle productivity is less with daily milk yield per cattle of about 4 litres, whereas the same is about 30 litres in US.18 Technology can help in increasing the productivity of the cattle. Each year farmers lose significant amounts of money due to animal illness. Using 5G enabled sensor devices, farmers can monitor pests and diseases in farm animals and act. These sensor devi ces can be fixed to the ear of the animal and farmers can find out remotely whether the animal is in heat stage or sick. Sensor devices can be fixed on its stomach to find out how good its digestive system is. Animal's behaviour, health, feeding patterns, food and water quality, hygiene levels can be monitored. Their location in the farm can be tracked and traced. Livestock reproductive cycles and the calving process can be tracked for safer and successful deliveries. D. Industrial Manufacturing 2.30. 5G technologies provide the network characteristics like low latency and high reliability that are key for addressing manufacturing use cases. It has the potential to address the key challenges in digitalization for industrial manufacturing. 5G networks offer manufactur ers and telecom operators the chance to build smart factories and truly take advantage of technologies such as automation, AI, IoT and augmented reality for troubleshooting. 2.31. Modern factories have advanced machines and robots equipped with a wide array of sensors connected to high-powered analytics engines in the cloud. They help in accomplishing tasks such as assess performance, manage production schedules, maintain supplies and orchestrate all the 17 India: cattle population 2023 | Statista 18 Milk per animal, 2021 (ourworldindata.org) (Source: FAO,UN) 40 activities on the factory floor. 5G will eliminate the nee d of wired connectivity and supplement the high-speed manufacturing environment with a far greater degree of flexibility. 5G -enabled factory will have the capacity to maintain connections among far greater number of sensors than either wired or previous wireless facilities.

H. Smart Cities 2.35. Smart cities are urban areas that use information and communication technologies to enhance the quality of life, efficiency of services and sustainability of resources. The 5G-based ubiquitous sensor network will become the cornerstone of smart city and one of the key infrastructures for the Internet of Everything, where people, machines, and things become deeply integrated. Featuring ultra -high speed, ultra -low latency and massive connectivity, 5G will provide all-round support to the innovation and development of smart city with the help of following use cases: i. Smart Transportation - 5G can enable vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle- to-infrastructure (V2I) communication , which can provide real -time information and alerts to drivers and pedestrians about traffic conditions, road hazards, collisions and other emergencies. 5G can also support advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving, which can reduce human errors and improve driving performance. 5G can enable traffic monitoring and control systems, which can collect and analyze data from various sources such as sensors, cameras, drones and vehicles. 5G can also enable dynamic traffic routing and optim ization, which can adjust traffic signals and lanes according to the traffic demand and situation. 5G can also support smart parking solutions, which can help drivers find available parking spaces and pay for them conveniently. 5G can support wireless charging and battery management for EVs, which can extend their range and lifespan. ii.

Smart Waste managemen t - Waste management is one of the major challenges faced by urban areas around the world. The traditional methods of waste collection and disposal are inefficient, costly, and harmful to the environment and public health. To address this problem, smart wa ste management has emerged as a promising solution that leverages IoT and 5G technologies to optimize waste management processes and improve service quality. Smart waste management involves using IoT-enabled smart waste sensors that are attached to waste bins or containers. These sensors can monitor the fill level, weight, temperature, and location of the waste, and transmit this data to a cloud-based platform via 5G networks. The platform can then analyze the data and provide real- time information and insi ghts to waste management operators, such as optimal collection routes, schedules, and frequencies, based on factors such as traffic conditions, weather, and demand patterns. Smart waste management can bring multiple benefits to cities, such as reducing operational costs, increasing efficiency and productivity, enhancing environmental sustainability, improving public health and safety, and creating new business opportunities and revenue streams. Some examples of cities that have implemented or are planning to implement smart waste management using 5G are Singapore, Fukuoka, San Diego, Vienna, and Brisbane. v. Environmental Monitoring and Pollution Control – Environmental monitoring and pollution control are essential tasks for ensuring the health and well -being of humans and ecosystems.

The processing and analysis of large volumes of environmental data can be done at the edge of the network, i mproving the speed, accuracy, and security of environmental decision -making. Meaningful insights from complex environmental data can be extracted using AI to detect anomalies and patterns, predict future scenarios and trends, and provide recommendations and solutions. V. Need of Collaboration based approach or Ecosystem for 5G 2.36. In Ecosystem strategy multiple stakeholders join hands for development of some technology or service. They are interdependent on other players and work in a coherent manner for providing solutions to users and customers. 5G promises to empower digitalization of many verticals, and for the sake of making it a success for all its stakeholders, applying ecosystem thinking can be a very powerful means. A telecom service provider can provide 5G service which co -exists with Information Technology (IT) service, system integration, software, and cloud services. When entering the industry verticals’ domain, providers of 5G services could collaborate with domain specific providers. 2.37. A collaboration-based approach or ecosystem has several advantages: i. It fosters innovation and creativity by allowing the various domain experts to leverage their respective strengths and capabilities, such as cloud computing, edge computing, artificial intelligence, and network slicing. ii. It reduces costs and risks by sharing resources, expertise, and responsibilities among the partners, as well as by creating economies of scale and scope. 46 iii.

It supports social and environmental sustai nability by promoting the development and deployment of cost-effective, energy-efficient, and secure 5G products and solutions. 2.38. Hence, the cross-sector collaboration in a 5G ecosystem will be required for (a) 5G network provisioning / deployment and (b) adoption of 5G use cases in different industry verticals . The 5G network deployment ecosystem includes all necessary providers, operators and suppliers needed to deliver 5G services to the customers. Similarly, the 5G use case ecosystems are composed of other players that assume roles necessary to develop and adopt 5G use cases. Manufacturing, Healthcare, Education and Automotive sectors are some of the industry verticals of 5G use cases ecosystem. Both these ecosystems and the associated challenges have been discussed in detail in the following sections. VI. Ecosystem for 5G network Deployment 2.39. As discussed earlier, 5G is not just expected to enhance the mobile broadband capacity but will also improve reliability and latency in the network giving rise to innovative use cases in the long term. In traditional telecom markets, the network and servic e provisioning roles have been performed by the TSPs being those Mobile and/or Fixed -network Infrastructure Providers. While established TSPs can undoubtedly play a key role in the 5G provisioning business at initial stages, the assumption of the complete end-to-end (E2E) 5G provisioning solely by them may not be practical to be followed throughout all stages of 5G deployment. At some point 5G deployment ecosystems can em erge in various formulations, expectedly with the TSPs maintaining the core service provisioning and sharing of some activities and roles with other stakeholders. In fact, 5G provisioning needs an ecosystem approach, 47 rather than working in siloes, where TS Ps need to partner with other industry stakeholders. Examples of such partnerships or collaborations along with practices being followed in the global marketplace and way forward are discussed in the following sections. 2.40. Cross-sector collaboration for infrastructure creation could either be in the beginning of the infrastructure development itself or at later stage by leveraging the existing assets of other sectors such as Power, cable TV, Road transport authorities , Railways, Metro Rail etc., which will pro vide improved connectivity, affordability, and sustainability. A clear roadmap is required for cross-sector infrastructure sharing along with setting up of an institutional framework to build synergies among these infrastructure sectors. 2.41. In the telecom se ctor, collaboration is not a new phenomenon. It has proven its worth when there was need of more towers to provide 3G services and the TSPs started collaborating within the sector for infrastructure co -creation and sharing. Independent infrastructure providers created towers and ducts that were shared and used by multiple TSPs. Now the outlook needs to shift from within the sector to collaboration with cross -sectoral partners like Smart Cities, City Municipalities, Airport/Port owners, DISCOMs etc. to use t heir street furniture for network deployment. Collaboration models involving state, local bodies and private sector are necessary for provisioning infrastructure in municipalities, rural areas and national highways for speedy rollout of 5G access and backhaul networks. 2.42. As there will be hundreds of thousands of small cells to be deployed on the available street furniture, ensuring power supply to the installed equipment in a cost-effective manner will be another challenging task. In addition to this, the administrative difficulty in applying for permission for individual street furniture is also an area of concern. To address this a 48 mechanism for simplified bulk approval is required to be developed. Most of the street furniture are established and owned by t he electricity authorities only and therefore the rental, RoW charges and approval of permission for using street furniture shall fall in their jurisdiction. Cross- sector collaboration between the Telecom and Power sectors will be required along with intervention from Telecom Regulator and Electricity Regulator to resolve this issue of power supply at site for 5G small cells. The initiatives",

Cross- sector collaboration between the Telecom and Power sectors will be required along with intervention from Telecom Regulator and Electricity Regulator to resolve this issue of power supply at site for 5G small cells. The initiatives taken by TRAI and Government for establishing and encouraging such collaborations are discussed in the following sections. A. Initiatives taken by TRAI 2.43. TRAI has taken initiative for cross -sectoral collaboration between the Telecom and Power sectors . At the behest of TRAI, Forum of India Regulators (FOIR) had c onstituted a working group on Cross Sector Collaborative Regulation for rolling out the 5G network in the country using the transmission and distribution network of power utilities. The FOIR Working Group has a representation of Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI), Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC), State Electricity Regulatory Commissions (SERCs), Distribution Companies (DISCOMs), Telecom licensees, Infrastructure Providers category- I (IP -I) and had a provision to co -opt experts fr om other organizations as well. The working group submitted its recommendations on cross sector collaboration for Aerial/underground fiber deployment, 5G Small Cells deployment, smart metering, smart grid monitoring and on issues related to rapid infrastru cture creation and faster rollout of 5G services. The report of the subgroup was discussed in FOIR and also in the Forum of Regulators (FOR) which resulted in identification of action points including SERCs regulations on revenue sharing between DISCOMs and consumers for income other than core business; single bill for multiple connections issued to the telecom service provider and 49 payment for all the commutative bills at one go, separate tariff slab for energy consumed by the telecom service providers. 2.44. TRAI has taken an initiative to form a Joint Committee of Regulators (JCOR) consisting of Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI), Reserve Bank of India (RBI), Securities & Exchanges Board of India (SEBI) and Ministry of Consumer Affairs (MoCA) to study future regulatory implications in the digital financial world and to collaboratively work on future regulations. The JCOR is working on various cross sectoral issues of Telecom and Financial sector including framing of joint action plan to curb financi al frauds using Telecom resources. Representatives from Ministry of Home Affairs and Department of Telecommunications also regularly participate in th e JCOR meetings and apprises the committee about the ongoing regulatory challenges. The committee tracks h ow regulatory frameworks are evolving in the digital economy and dives deep into policy trends. 2.45. Countries need to recognize that they need to transition away from regulatory interventions and policies discussed and implemented in silos within one agency o r ministry. Going forward, regulatory and policy development frameworks should be implemented cross -sectionally in a collaborative fashion. Recognizing its importance, the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) has been advocating in the past years the need to implement a new approach to ICT regulation, labelled fifth generation collaborative regulation. The underlying premise of such an approach is the need for countries to migrate to a regulatory and policy framework based on the collaboration among multiple sectors . In this context, ITU has developed G5 benchmark index to measure how countries transition to a holistic digital collaborative regulation and policy making in the digital economy. Due to the regulatory initiatives taken in India, it has been categorized as a country having advanced stage of 50 collaborative regulation in the G5 benchmark index, which is the highest category. 2.46. For the deployment of Small Cells using street furniture, TRAI initiated four pilot projects 19 one each covering a Port, Airport, Metro line and a congested city area in a smart city. These pilots have been carried out at Deendayal Port Kandla, Delhi Internat ional Airport, Nama Metro Bengaluru, and Smart City Bhopal. The objective of these pilot projects was to understand and analyze the technical and logistical challenges in future deployment of small cells over street furniture and to ensure complete synergy among all stakeholders. Based on learnings from these pilots and further consultations, TRAI has issued comprehensive recommendations dated 29 th November 2022 on “USE OF STREET FURNITURE FOR SMALL CELL AND AERIAL FIBER DEPLOYMENT”. The emphasis of these",

Based on learnings from these pilots and further consultations, TRAI has issued comprehensive recommendations dated 29 th November 2022 on “USE OF STREET FURNITURE FOR SMALL CELL AND AERIAL FIBER DEPLOYMENT”. The emphasis of these recommendations is to create a regulatory framework which facilitates collaboration and participation among various departments, central and state agencies, local bodies, and service providers to ensure successful and rapid rollout of small cells and optical fiber using street furniture. 2.47. The Authority has time and again emphasised the need of cross sector collaboration through various recommendations. For example, for creation of centralised National Portal for RoW permissions to facilitate expeditious rollout of telecom and other essential utilities infrastructure , through its recommendations on 'Roadmap to Promote Broadband Connectivity and Enhanced Broadband Speed' 20 dated 31.08.2021, the Authority has recommended that: “wherever Appropriate Authorities, i.e. different Central Government Departments, States, Union Territories, Local Authorities and their agencies, 19 https://trai.gov.in/sites/default/files/Pilot_Report_29112022.pdf 20 https://trai.gov.in/sites/default/files/Recommendations_31082021.pdf 51 have already established the web based portals for grant of RoW permissions, the same should be integrated wit h the proposed national portal for RoW permissions.” 2.48. Based on the above Recommendations, “GatiShakti Sanchar Portal”21 has been launched. This portal is a collaborative institutional mechanism between all stakeholders including Central and State/UT Government(s), Local bodies, and Service Providers to facilitate the Right of Way (RoW) Application Process through a single interface. The GatiShakti Sanchar Portal is also integrated with the Ministry of Railways, Ministry of Road, Transport & H ighways, and Ministry of Defence. Shortly, it will be integrated with the Ministry of Environment, Forest, and Climate Change. 2.49. To further strengthen this collaborative initiative , the Authority in its recommendations dated 29th November 2022 on “Use of Street Furniture for small cell and aerial fiber deployment” has reiterated its earlier recommendations dated 31.08.2022 to expand this portal to integrate other utility providers also like water, electricity, gas . TRAI has also received a reference from DoT for auction of E and V bands for backhaul and currently working on it. Radio waves in E band, which falls in 71-76 GHz and 81-86 GHz, and V band, that is 57-64 GHz, can transmit data at very high speeds, and very much suitable for 5G backhaul. 2.50. The Authority in its Recommendations dated 20th February 2023 22 on “Rating of Buildings or Areas for Digital Connectivity ” has recommended a collaborative approach, wherein the Central Government may work with State Governments/ UTs for incorporation of suit able provisions for Digital Connectivity Infrastructure ( DCI) development in the respective bye-laws or other relevant laws of the State Governments/ UTs. In the same recommendations, establishment of Council of DCI (CoDCI) has also 21 https://gatishaktisanchar.gov.in/ 22 https://trai.gov.in/sites/default/files/Recommendation_22032023.pdf 52 been suggested under the Department of Telecommunications (DoT), in collaboration with the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA), All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE), National Skill Development Council (NSDC), Telecom Sector Skill Council (TSSC), an d Construction Skill Development Council (CSDC) or any other organisation/institution as deemed appropriate. The CoDCI shall be responsible for taking all decisions in respect of certification, registration and capacity building of DCI Professionals. B. Initiatives taken by Government 2.51. The Government has taken several initiatives for digital infrastructure development in the recent past as enumerated below: i. USOF initiatives like BharatNet project has been rolled out to provide nationwide digital connectivity infrastructure in rural areas. Under BharatNet program, 1,91,000 Gram Panchayats (cluster of villages) have been covered and 104,600 Public Wi -Fi hotspots have been installed for universal connectivity. ii. Mobile services in uncovered villages in North -eastern Region (NER) and Border Areas, 4G mobile saturation in remote and rural India and Island connectivity through submarine OFC has helped in provision of quality and affordable mobi le and digital services across the rural and remote areas of the country. iii.To ensure ease of doing business and creation of infrastructure at lower costs, a Centralized National Portal for obtaining Right of Way (RoW) called “GatiShakti Sanchar” Portal for cable laying and tower installation has been started. States and other central ministries are also integrated with this portal. iv. Street",

States and other central ministries are also integrated with this portal. iv. Street furniture has been included in RoW portal for faster 5G rollout. 53 v. Sharing of Active and Passive Infrastructure among Service Providers have been permitted to enable them to expand their network coverage and improve the quality of service, while reducing capital expenditure and operating costs, especially in remote and rural areas. vi. For improved security of netw ork, a mechanism has been established to procure equipment from Trusted Source only. With robust cyber security measures, India ranked 10th in ITU’s Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI). viii. USOF has also launched Telecom Technology Development Fund (TTDF) Scheme in October 2022, which aims to fund R&D in rural -specific communication technology applications and form synergies among academia, start-ups, research institutes, and the industry to build and develop the telecom ecosystem. Additionally, the Scheme aims to promote technology ownership and indigenous manufacturing, create a culture of technology co-innovation, reduce imports, boost export opportunities and creation of Intellectual Property. VII. Ecosystem for 5G Use Cases 2.52. 5G technology holds the potential to enable unprecedented degrees of flexibility, productivity, and efficiency in various industry verticals. The potential of 5G, combined with AI, AR/VR, smart platforms and IoT, can deliver enormous value to consumers, organizations, and the society at large. It will also pave the way for developing services for making smart cities, autonomous vehicles, smart factories, etc. Thus, 5G vision extends beyond mobile broadband connectivity and provides an opportunity to Telecom Service Providers (TSPs) to transform themselves into a Digital Service Provider. Telecom industry has been transitioning from different generations of mobile technologies since last few decades and has been pivoting from voice to content to commerce and industrial applications. However, to realise the true potential of 5G beyond the eMBB use cases, 54 the ICT industry and all the vertical industries must come together as an ecosystem for development and deployment of mature use cases. 2.53. The core competency of TSPs today is in providing network connectivity. To realise the potential benefits of 5G, the network needs to transform into a digital platform and be delivered as a service in the digital marketplace. Most of the implementations of 5G use cases will be b rownfield implementations where the 5G solution needs to seamlessly integrate with existing business processes, IT systems and operational technologies. TSPs will need to adopt an ecosystem and build trusted and strategic partnerships with other ecosystem players for faster and mass -scale adoption of 5G use cases. Mobile operators are collaborating with vendors and enterprises across different verticals to develop and deploy 5G use cases for industry. Some such collaborations happening across the globe are discussed below. A. International Experience: 2.54. Mobile operators are collaborating with vendors and enterprises across different verticals to explore the potential of 5G stand-alone (SA) network. For example, SoftBank and Honda are working together to test the effectiveness of using 5G SA and a cellular vehicle -to-everything (C-V2X) system to reduce collisions between pedestrians and vehicles. In Spain, Telefónica has announced plans to target three enterprise 5G use cases for its 5G SA network. They are automat ed guided robot vehicles for use in places such as warehouses; remote maintenance systems using technology such as smart glasses; and drones for site surveillance.23 2.55. South Korea 's 5G ecosystem brought together government ministries, legislative bodies, telecom operators, vendors , research institutes and 23 GSMA Mobile Economy 2022 report 55 other stakeholders such as trade unions, civil society groups at the very early stages of the 5G buildout. This led to an environment of cooperation and tremendous technology breakthroughs and cost benefits. Future technologies were tested in an evolved beta market, technology standards were established, and a strong market adoption strategy was created well in advance of the commercialisation. Subsequently, telecom operators in South Korea introduced 5G -powered services and each operator offered unique content and experience use cases. Some of them included: i.

South Korean Telecom's TReal and eSpace have built platforms where baseball fans can access real -time data and stats by pointing their smartphone camera at a baseball player. They can point a VR headset at the field and watch the game from eight different angles. ii. LG U+ Idol Live that allows K-Pop fans to enjoy a concert as they would do in a real theatre. iii. South Korean Telecom's 5G -AI Machine Vision, a smart factory solution that uploads high -resolution, multi-angle photos to a cloud server via a 5G router, instantly identifying defective products on a conveyor belt. Applications like these have spiked the data consumption in the country and led to increased average revenue per user (ARPU). 2.56. Singapore has become the first country in the world to be fully covered by standalone 5G. The island nation now has achieved over 95% of 5G nationwide coverage. It has managed to achieve these three years ahead of scheduled target, which was by the end of 2025.24 As part of its earlier 5G innovation efforts, IMDA supported seven 5G innovation use -cases in strategic areas such as cloud gaming, urban mobility, smart estates, industry 4.0 and maritime operations. In 2019, IMDA has partnered with 24 https://techwireasia.com/2022/07/singapore-is-first-in-the-world-for-nationwide-5g- coverage 56 the Maritime & Port Authority of Singapore (“MPA”) and PSA25 Singapore, to test and commercialize maritime 5G use cases, starting with the remote pilotage of vessels that are entering the port of Singapore. This will significantly enhance service efficiency, improve resource uti lisation and transform the role of a harbour pilot from a physically demanding job to remote operations while enhancing safety. Other maritime 5G use cases include shore-to-ship delivery, where drones can send critical components to vessels out at sea inst ead of having ships dock at the berth for urgent inspections and repairs.26 2.57. In Hong Kong, HKT, one of the leading telecom operator in the country, is working with enterprises to integrate different technologies like 5G, AI and cloud computing to help them transform their operations. For example: i. HKT is working on a wide range of smart campus and smart building projects. These require a building to be equipped with 5G enabled sensors to detect and regulate temperature, humidity, lighting, appliances and air quality and also AI -based energy saving algorithms to help buildings minimise energy usage. ii. HKT provides end -to-end services to accelerate enterprise digital transformation – from consulting and solution design to project implementation and delivery. Their Enterprise Managed Services also offer multi-skilled supports catering IT operations and end user support requests. iii. HKT is also maintaining a stron g partnership with OEM s across many technology domains, including fibre networks, 4G and 5G networks, and for enterprise services such as cloud, storage, networking and Wi-Fi. They 25 Container transhipment hub 26https://www.imda.gov.sg/Content-and-News/Press-Releases-and-Speeches/Press- Releases/2021/Singapore-accelerates-5G-adoption-and-commercialisation-with-new- 30m-fund 57 are working together to co-create products and services like a 5G solution integrated with Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and an IoT connectivity platform. 2.58. Australia is a global leader in 5G rollout. By the end of 2021, Australia’s Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) had installed around 4,000 operational 5G base stations across the country. 5G in novation has accelerated in Australia due to collaborations and co -investments between companies and across industries. Telstra recently collaborated with Ericsson and Microsoft to begin 5G -enabled edge compute trials earlier this year. 27 Similarly, Austra lian technology companies M2M Connectivity and ARQ Group formed a partnership to deliver digital twin technology for mining companies looking to use 5G to increase production efficiency and lower operational costs.28 2.59.

JSTOR, https://www.jstor.org/stable/26924960. Accessed 12 Apr. 2023. 64 devices. Through connected wearables and sensors, healthcare professionals can monitor patients' vital signs, track medication adherence, and provide personalized care even f rom a distance. IoT technologies can also play a pivotal role in agriculture by enabling precision farming, livestock monitoring, and smart irrigation systems. Farmers can use IoT devices to collect real -time data on weather conditions, soil moisture, and nutrient levels, allowing them to make informed decisions about when and how to plant, fertilize, and irrigate their crops. 3.4 Despite the numerous benefits and potential applications of IoT technologies, several policy challenges must be addressed to ensure their effective implementation and propagation. One of the most significant challenges is ensuring the privacy and security of the vast amount of data generated and transmitted by IoT devices. Interoperability and standardization are also crucial policy challenges that must be addressed to facilitate the effective implementation and propagation of IoT technologies. Moreover, the rapid deployment of IoT technologies can have significant implications for the labour market, as automation and increased efficie ncy may lead to job displacement in certain sectors.

These applications span a wide range of industries, including smart cities and infrastructure, Industry 4.0 and smart manufacturing, healthcare and remote patient monitoring, smart homes an d buildings, and agriculture and precision farming. IoT enabled applications hold tremendous potential to transform various sectors and improve the quality of life for citizens. However, to ensure the effective implementation and propagation of these techn ologies, regulators and policymakers need to address a range of policy challenges, including data privacy and security, 65 spectrum management, interoperability and standardization, environmental impact, workforce displacement, and ethical considerations. By proactively addressing these challenges and fostering collaboration between stakeholders, the responsible and sustainable growth of the IoT ecosystem can be ensured and its full potential can be unlocked for the betterment of society. II. IoT Use Cases across Industry Verticals 3.6 According to a report by Statista, IoT technology holds significant potential across industries. The study predicts that there will be around 50 billion IoT devices connected by 2030. As the IoT continues to unroll globally and spread across sectors, some industries are leading investments in this revolutionary technology, changing how we live and work. A. Healthcare 3.7 The pandemic made Healthcare professionals and patients realise the importance of digital healthcare technologies firsthand. A report by S&P Global found that telehealth patient volumes increased by almost 4,000% in the year 2020 by June. This growing acceptance suggests that digital telehealth is here to stay. 5G connectivity will take it to the next level. High speed and ubiquitous, 5G will give medical professionals the ability to provide round the clock care to patients in hazardous or remote areas. Wearable monitors will be used to track patients’ vital signs. And in the process, patients will be able to get away from the need for time - consuming in -person hospital appointments and consultations. There should be considerable cost reduction. According to eMarketer, 5G could save the healthcare industry $600 million in 2021 —with annual global savings reaching nearly $94 billion by 2030. 3.8 Further ahead, there is the prospect of even more dramatic interventions like remote surgery. The first experiments have already happened. In Birmingham UK, a doctor used a zero-latency 5G connection to perform a procedure. The clinician viewed the patient through a VR headset to guide 66 a paramedic through the process with haptic glove technology. Elsewhere, even more ambitious projects are underway. In Korea, KT Corporation and Samsung Medical Centre are building a 5G private network to enable a ‘smart hospital’. It will provide support for digital diagnostics, surgical education, AI-enabled care for inpatients, and even an autonomous robot for an operat ing room. The two companies say the delivery robot can remove contaminated materials and bring in surgery supplies. This will reduce the risk of infection. 5G-enabled connectivity will enable the robot to exchange data with minimal latency. B. Education 3.9 India is an emerging player in the global education industry, with one of the world's largest networks of higher education institutions. With this exponential growth, the market size of the education industry was about 117 billion U.S. dollars across India in f inancial year 2020 , which is estimated to rise to 225 billion U.S. dollars by financial year 2025 in the country.31 The IoT is transforming the education sector and enabling educational institutions to become Wi -Fi-enabled smart learning environments. IoT allows educational institutes to increase safety in campuses, improve the quality of education, saves teachers from the tremendous paperwork, and keep track of enrolments. 3.10 Smart technology has the potential to make schools safer. Facial recognition analytics through well-featured CCTVs, for example, can track students' entry and exit from the classroom and school grounds. This measure also helps to keep intruders and other unauthorised individuals out of schools. Furthermore, smarter security cameras can be relied upon to monitor hallways and building perimeters in order to keep students safe and ensure a safe learning environment for them.",

This measure also helps to keep intruders and other unauthorised individuals out of schools. Furthermore, smarter security cameras can be relied upon to monitor hallways and building perimeters in order to keep students safe and ensure a safe learning environment for them. Educational institutions can provide substantial levels of security by connecting everything from 31 https://www.statista.com/statistics/1286064/india-education-industry-market-size/ 67 security cameras to school buses that enable real -time information sharing and quick emergency response. 3.11 IoT can also help in conserving energy in educational institutions and thereby addressing the gl obal warming concerns . Installing sensors and actuators in taps and lights can automatically switch them off in the absence of human beings. RFID tags in students ID cards can record attendance of students daily. IoT can also be helpful in monitoring the health of students and staff. IoT also helps in storing information such as blood pressure, medical history, allergies, prescription details to take necessary treatment in case of an unfortunate accident. 3.12 Smartboards have made learning interactive by projecting images. Words and numbers on textbooks and blackboards do not explain the concepts as easily as smartboards. Consequently, IoT training is also becoming a part of teachers’ skills. IoT enabled smart devices make learning easier for students with sensory disabilities. For instance, they can convert verbal speech to sign language and vice versa. Similarly, transcripts convert voice to text, so that students with a hearing disability can read out the notes , and text to voice helping blind students. C. Agriculture 3.13 Agriculture industry has always been very receptive to technical innovation. It has become quite technology -driven and industrialized by embracing the IoT. The growth of IoT use in Agriculture is seen from t he report by Statista, which presents the worldwide IoT market size of the agriculture sector in 2018 as 14.79 billion USD. It is projected to reach almost 30 billion USD by 2030. The term Smart agriculture denotes the application of IoT solutions in agric ulture. It uses IoT sensors to collect environmental and machine metrics. The data can help farmers to make informed decisions and improve just about every area of their work – from livestock to crop farming. 68 Use Cases of IoT in Agriculture i. Smart Irrigation Systems – Smart irrigation systems use IoT sensors to monitor soil moisture levels and weather conditions, optimizing irrigation scheduling to conserve water and improve crop yields. For example, drip irrigation based on intelligent inputs has t he potential for much greater efficiency and water conservation. ii. Crop Monitoring and Precision Agriculture - IoT devices and sensors can be used to monitor crop health and environmental conditions, enabling farmers to make data -driven decisions about ferti lization, pest control, and other agricultural practices. iii. Agricultural Drones - Agricultural drones are equipped with sensors and cameras. They are used for imaging, mapping, and surveying farms. Drones can be used to collect aerial data on crop health and environmental conditions, providing farmers with valuable information for decision-making. Besides the surveillance capabilities, drones can perform a variety of tasks that previously required human labour like planting crops, fighting pests, agriculture spraying, crop monitoring, etc. iv. Greenhouse Automation - Farmers usually use manual intervention to control the greenhouse environment. IoT sensors help them get accurate real-time information on greenhouse conditions like lighting, temperature, soil condition, and humidity. v. Monitoring climate conditions - Weather stations combined with smart farming sensors collect data from the environment and send it to the cloud for analysis. It is further used to map the climate conditions, choose the right crops, and improve their capacity. vi. Cattle monitoring - IoT-enabled livestock tracking and health monitoring systems allow farmers to monitor the location, health, and behaviour of their animals, improving animal welfare and farm productivity. Thus, IoT, edge computing, blockchain, machine learning, robotics and drones are help ing farmers unlock new efficiencies, eliminate waste and develop new ways to track commodities from the farm to the market. 69 3.14 Behind all of these impactful applications and use cases is, of course, 5G technology.

For farmers, the particular benefit of 5G is its reach into remote areas. Rural areas will likely get a low band 5G , which will have less capacity but will extend into previously unserved areas. It will still have very low latency and be able to connect massive networks of industrial sensors. This will give farmers the ability to monitor remote livestock and crops constantly and in real time, without the need to physically visit. Meanwhile the high data throughput of 5G will enable a different set of benefits. D. Energy (Gas, Electricity) 3.15 As per an industry report 32, the global value of IoT in the Energy market was 20.2 billion USD in 2020. It is expected to increase to 35.2 billion USD by 2025. IoT has started revolutionizing most aspects of the Energy sector from generation to transmission to distribution and impacting how energy companies and customers interact. As per another report 33, IoT is deployed by 45% of Energy companies to monitor asset performance and being used by 43% of En ergy companies to enhance customer experiences. 40% of Energy companies have reported an overall boost in productivity with use of IoT. Smart grids, Resource optimisation, advanced automation, Remote assets monitoring and management, Process optimization, Grid balancing, disaster prevention, Smart decision making and Innovative power solutions are some of the IoT enabled use cases transforming the energy sector. 3.16 IoT sensors can monitor and control energy consumption and production in real time, reducing waste and costs. For example, smart thermostats can adjust the temperature based on occupancy and weather conditions, saving energy and improving comfort. IoT devi ces can enable the integration of renewable energy sources into the grid, creating 32 IoT in energy market size forecast 2020-2025 | Statista 33 How IoT Is Impacting 7 Key Industries Today (forbes.com) 70 decentralized and resilient networks that can operate independently or in sync with the main grid. For example, smart meters can measure and communicate energy usage and generation, facilitating demand response and load balancing. 3.17 IoT devices can enhance the performance and security of the power grid, detecting and preventing faults, outages and cyberattacks. For example, smart transformers can monitor and regulate voltage, f requency and power quality, improving grid stability and efficiency. IoT devices can automate various processes and operations in the energy sector, such as data collection, analysis, decision making and action. For example, smart valves can regulate the flow of oil and gas based on sensor data, optimizing production and preventing leaks. 3.18 IoT based solutions can reduce hazards and increase safety for both workers and the power plants. Sensors installed all around the plant can notice any leakage or damage and can send alerts to a mobile application and the staff takes the necessary precautions. Instead of waiting for the plant to cause serious injuries and irreversible losses, IoT can notify the staff members beforehand of any risks. This helps in ensuring s mooth running of processes and increase in safety. E. Industry 4.0 & Beyond 3.19 150 years ago, the manufacturing sector went through a sudden transformation; the production line was born. Before this, artisans used to make most products on their own. Mass production and assembly lines drastically improved the speed – and decreased the cost – of making everyday items. Today, again, manufacturing is on the brink of similar change because of IoT-enabled smart production, also known as Industry 4.0 or the industrial IoT. Currently, the manufacturing industry is the most prominent investor in the IoTs. 3.20 In this new age, a factory’s traditionally linear systems become dynamic and interconnected. Smart machines work together to do much more than 71 merely physical work. Instead, they collect, share and analyse data in order to: i. Keep track of products and assets - Factory managers are able to track parts as they move through the assembly process using smart sensors. This gives them a real -time view of stock situation and this visibility will extend across the entire supply chain.",

Keep track of products and assets - Factory managers are able to track parts as they move through the assembly process using smart sensors. This gives them a real -time view of stock situation and this visibility will extend across the entire supply chain. The Industrial IoT will give them potential access to real -time data from their transport and logistics partners. ii. Monitor product quality - The addition of environmental sensors inside factories could help companies improve the quality of their goods. The sensors can send alerts when quality deteriorates below ‘optimal’. iii. Predictive maintenance - Machine downtimes are costly. With the clever use of sensor data, it is possible to detect when a machine is showing signs of malfunction before it ceases to work completely. This raises the prospect of proactive repair – also known as predictive maintenance resulting into reduced downtime, longer equipment life spans and safer factory environments. 3.21 With the addition of 5G always -on connectivity and miniature-embedded sensors, ‘dumb’ products can be provided with the ability to feed information back to the factory. This way, quality issues can be detected. More than that, the factory can learn about routes to market and customer choices – and then use these insights to make better products in the future. For example, in 2020 pharmaceutical company Bayer announced a printable NB-IoT-based tracking label, which costs just a few euros, to monitor its products through the supply chain. F. Automotive Sector 3.22 The IoT in the automotive industry allows connected cars to stay in real - time communication with the surrounding connected ecosystem. This is making advanced innovations possible and steadily transforming the automotive industry in the following ways: 72 i. IoT-enabled in-vehicle infotainment systems provide services like music streaming, navigation, voice assistance, hands-free calling, etc. ii. IoT solutions constantly monitor vehicle condition to predict potential issues. IoT sensors gather real -time data on fuel consump tion, engine temperature, fluid levels, run time, etc. This data is then analyzed to detect pre-failure conditions and alert the driver in advance. This approach to maintenance, compared to traditional scheduled check -ups, can help avoid unnecessary expenses and save time and efforts while also helping prevent vehicle breakdowns. iii. Integrated IoT sensors help connect cars and enable vehicle -to-vehicle (V2V) interaction. Cars can share relevant information like location, route, speed, etc. This feature helps prevent accidents and makes roads safer. In case of emergency, drivers of other cars in proximity may be notified to take preventive measures or slow down their car. V2V connection also helps emergency vehicles navigate through traffic. iv. IoT enabled semi-autonomous vehicles can take partial control of driving, braking, parking, or lane changing. IoT solutions and integrated in-vehicle cameras help smart vehicles calculate the safest and most efficient course of action to provide driving assistance and reduce the likelihood of road accidents. v. IoT enriches fleet management with new advanced functionality, making it more cost -efficient and reducing the need for manual operations. The IoT devices integrated into vehicles collect real -time data about vehicle speed, location, load, fuel consumption, driver behaviour, etc. Gaining insights from this data with the help of IoT analytics solutions, fleet management operators can automatically calculate the most optimal routes, monitor the driving habits of their employee s, screen vehicle performance, and leverage predictive maintenance to avoid business disruptions. 73 G. Smart Cities 3.23 IoT can be used in many ways to make cities more efficient ranging from managing the traffic, controlling air pollution, handling waste management, creating smart buildings, planning for natural disasters, etc. An overview of the most popular use cases that a re already implemented in smart cities across the globe has been provided below. i. Smart traffic management uses different types of sensors, a nd fetch GPS data from drivers’ smart phones to determine the number, location and the speed of vehicles. At the sa me time, smart traffic lights connected to a cloud management platform allow monitoring green light timings and automatically alter the lights based on current traffic situation to prevent congestion.

Smart parking solutions uses GPS data from drivers’ smartphones or road- surface sensors embedded in the ground on parking spots to determine whether the parking spots are occupied or available and create a real-time parking map. When the closest parking spot becomes free, drivers receive a notification and use the map on their phone to find a parking spot faster and easier instead of blindly driving around. iii. Connected Public transport ation employ IoT technology to improve the reliability, safety, and convenience of public transport by providing real- time information to passengers and operators about the location, schedule, and status of public transports. iv. Smart Waste management solutions enabled by IoT help to optimize waste collecting schedules by tracking waste levels, as well as providing route optimization and operational analytics. v. Environmental monitoring solutions allow tracking parameters critical for a healthy environment to maintain them at an optimal level. For example, to monitor water quality, a city can deploy a network of sensors across the water grid to measure the contamination level in the water supplied to the 74 citizens and connect them to a cloud management platform. When the contamination level reaches a certain threshold , the solution alerts maintenance teams, who then start fixing the issue. Similar information can be gathered with respect to the air quality also and recommendations can be made for the citizens. vi. Smart Public Safety solutions offer real -time monitoring, analytics, and decision-making tools. Combining data from acoustic sensors and CCTV cameras deployed throughout the city with the data from social media feed and analyzing it, public safety solutions can predict potential crime scenes. This will allow the police to stop potential perpetrators or successfully track them. III. Policy Challenges and Issues for Consultation 3.24 5G enabled IoT use cases hold tremendous potential to transform various sectors and improve the quality of life for citizens. These applications span a wide range of industries, including smart cities and infrastructure, Industry 4.0 and smart manufacturing, healthcare and remote patient monitoring, smart homes and buildings, and agriculture and precision farming.

UpSkilling for Industry 4.0 & beyond 3.28 As Industry 4.0 model gains ground across manufacturing and service industries, the future is set to be greatly transformed. Characterised by the convergence of digital technologies cutting across the physical and digital worlds, Industry 4.0 will make man y jobs and ways of working redundant while many others will be created afresh. But what separates Industry 4.0 from the previous revolutions is the unprecedented speed and spread of technological change. The skill sets that were in demand till a few years ago are now becoming obsolete. India’s largest HR challenge is to upskill a large number of industrial employees to enable them to understand the benefits and consequences of adopting this use case. 3.29 Working persons in the industries must be provided opportunities to reskill or upskill for ascertaining that they remain relevant for the new roles in the age of automation. In such a scenario, the industry, academia, and the government need to play a bigger role in enabling the emergence of an Industry 4.0 -compatible workforce. Such skilling initiatives can be fast-tracked via subsidies, tax incentives, and other supportive measures for MSMEs to acquire the requisite Industry 4.0 talent. In view of above, the question arises is: Q.6. Industry 4.0 encompasses Artificial intelligence, Robotics, Big data, and the Internet of things and set to change the nature of jobs. (a) What measures would you suggest for upskilling the top management and owners of industries? (b) What measures would you sug gest for upskilling the workforce of industries? (c) What kind of public private partnership models can be adopted for this upskilling task? Please reply with proper justification and reasons and also by referring to the global best practices in this regard. C. MSMEs and Industry 4.0 & beyond 77 3.30 Micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) play a pivotal role in the growth of manufacturing sector in a nation's economy. In the current post- pandemic period, it is difficult for any nation to envisage significant industrial growth without implementing radical tran sformation in their MSMEs. MSMEs are considered the pillars of Indian economy due to their considerable contribution to GDP, exports and employment generation. Contribution of the MSME sector to the Gross Value Added (GVA) in the country's GDP has been aro und 30% over the past few years. 34 MSME sector accounted for 49.5% of India's total exports in FY 21. 12.33 Million people were employed by MSMEs as on 1st June 2023.35 3.31 India has an estimated 633.88 lakh unincorporated non -agriculture MSMEs in the country engaged in different economic activities , of which 324.88 lakh MSMEs are based in rural areas and 309 lakh are from urban areas, engaged in different economic activities .36 Figure 3.1 shows the distribution of MSMEs activity wise.

The share of the MSME manufacturing in All India manufacturing during the year 2019-20 w as 36.9%.37 It also created many employment opportunities. Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) rely heavily on the MSME suppliers to keep their supply chains running smoothly. Also, the 'AtmaNirbhar Bharat' initiative is heavily dependent on MSMEs, especially the strategic sectors that have critical implications on our national priorities. In the current competitive environment, the MSMEs will have to keep pace with the changes in support systems, manufacturing processes, skillsets, customer service needs and technology for their sustainability. 3.33 Technology intervention is pushin g manufacturing to a new level of operation in the form of Industry 4.0. Under the umbrella of Industry 4.0, operational digitization, interacting machines, robots, automation, data analytics and swift data -driven intelligent decisions are the critical integrating pillars. Industry 4.0 transform manufacturing operations to become more efficient, productive, and profitable. The continuously increasing global competition is compelling companies to expand and connect internal manufacturing processes with the e xternal supplier processes and customer expectations. I ndustry 4.0 (I4.0) leverages the data intelligence to eliminate system wastes and add more value to the end-customer. 3.34 Various studies h ave indicated that there are many challenges that MSMEs are facing to embrace I4.0.38 The major challenges are: i. Lack of a constructive push or nudge by enterprise owners or top management or parent company for this futuristic transformational leap, ii. Fear of the likely resource pressures- finance, technology, human-talent, infrastructure, and new operational skill, iii. Fear of exorbitant cost of transitioning from the existing state to the new 37 https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=1744032 posted on 9th Aug2021 38https://www.entrepreneur.com/en-in/growth-strategies/indian-msmes-aiming-to-embrace- industry-40-fears-and/431323 79 I4.0 state of operation, iv. Potential concerns in Information technology related capabilities in terms of investment, operation, interoperability, cyber security, etc. v. Fear of embracing this radical I4.0 approach which is still to provide tangible and visible deliverables and has a risky return on investment. Initiatives taken in India 3.35 The Government’s focus on MSME was reflected in the union budget for the fiscal year 2023 -24, in which Rs.22,138 crore was allocated for the ministry of MSME. As per SBI report released in January 2023, incentives provided by the emergency credit line guarantee scheme are boosting the credit flow to the MSME. 3.36 The “Gramodyog Vikas Yojana Grant” is provided by Government of India to meet the developmental needs of the Village Industry sector which comprise six broad groups such as Agro Based & Food Processing Industry (ABFPI), Mineral Based Industry (M BI), Wellness & Cosmetics Industry (WCI), Hand Made Paper, Leather & Plastic Industry (HPLPI), Rural Engineering & New Technology Industry (RENTI), and Service Industry. Budgetary allocations under Gramodyog Vikas Yojana are also provided for supporting ac tivities such as Science & Technology (V.I.), Capacity Building (Training to artisans), Publicity & Propaganda, Economic Research (EcR), Information Technology (IT), Audit, Estate & Services and other supporting activities. 3.37 CHAMPIONS (Creation and Harmonious Application of Modern Processes for Increasing the Output and National Strength) portal was launched by Hon’ble Prime Minister on 1st June, 2020. It is an ICT based technology system for making the smaller units big by helping and handholding them. A ne twork of control rooms , with central Control Room in the office of Ministry of MSME New Delhi and 68 State level control rooms, is created. They have been providing every possible support on a local level to MSMEs in the areas including finance, market acc ess, technology upgradation, skill development etc. 80 3.38 Under AatmaNirbhar Bharat Package, the Government of India announced to set up an INR 10,000 crore Fund of Funds for MSMEs. This fund, which is called Self Reliant India (SRI) Fund has the objective of supporting Venture Capital (VC) / Private Equity (PE) firms to encourage them to invest in the MSME segment. This Fund will address the equity funding challenges of MSME sector and give them a thrust to break their barriers, encourage corporatisation and all ow them to grow to their full inherent",

It is expected that the initiatives of SRI Fund shall provide significant liquidity nearly INR 50,000 cr to MSME sector, thereby enabling economic growth of the country. 3.39 Ministry of MSME has developed a robust skilling eco-system to meet the demands of skilled workforce in the various emerging and traditional sectors in different segments of enterprises. The Ministry has been organizing a number of skill development progra mmes/ courses for the existing and potential entrepreneurs, in order to build their capacity. The objective of t hese training courses is to fill up the gap of requirement of skilled workforce in the MSME sector in consonance with the changing landscape of the MSME Ecosystem and its present challenges in India. Skill training programmes are conducted by a network of institutions under the Ministry i.e. Khadi & Village Industry Commission (KVIC), Coir Board, National Small Industries Corporation Ltd. (NSIC), National Institutes for MSME (ni -msme) and MSME – Technology Centres (TCs). The intake eligibility for the training programmes ranges from school drop out to M.Tech. level. Various levels of courses, viz. certificates, diploma, advance diploma, post graduate diploma and post graduate courses are offered by these institutions. 3.40 The Authority in its recommendations dated 11 th April 2022 on “A uction of Spectrum in frequency bands identified for IMT/5G” ha s emphasised that timely intervention and hand holding of MSME sector will help India to increase its share in the international value chain system and play a 81 significant role in the Indian and global digital economy. The Authority recommended that: DoT should take up the matter with Ministry of MSME to carry out a study to find out the actual details about the level of acceptance and adoption of 5G based industrial automation and digital techn ologies by the MSME sector in the country as compared to other industries. Based on the learning from such study, appropriate schemes, including interest subvention scheme, for upgradation of plant and machinery, may be devised to facilitate the MSMEs to overcome various constraints and move towards industrial automation. In this regard, budgetary provisions (if required), may be created by the Ministry of MSME. 3.41 Despite all these initiatives taken by the Authority and the government, MSMEs in India have so far not shown an enthusiastic response to this fast-approaching digital transformation. Whereas, in developed economies of the world these enterprises are adopting Industry 4.0 package and are capturing the benefits across the entire manufacturing value chain — increasing production capacity and reducing material losses, improving customer service and reducing delivery lead times, achieving higher employee satisfaction and reducing their environmental impact. In spite of having high pote ntial, most MSMEs are confronted with barriers in embracing I4.0 practices in India. Many of them are still hesitant to step out of their comfort zone, ignorant of the adverse impact of not adopting I4.0 in the highly competitive business journey ahead. In view of this, the inputs of stakeholders are sought on the following: Q.7. What are the policy, regulatory and other challenges faced by MSMEs in adoption of Industry 4.0. Kindly suggest measures to address these challenges. Provide detailed justification with reasons along with the best practices in other countries. 82 D. Security 3.42 Ensuring effective security practices is essential in the development and design stage of IoT devices. Principles such as confidentiality, reliability, safety, availab ility, robustness, survivability, authenticity, resilience, identity management, access control, accountability and utility play a key role in the development of security of the IoT connected devices. With an increase in the demand for IoT devices, develop ers and manufacturers have more focus on increasing the quantity of devices instead of ensuring the quality of devices.

International Experience 3.43 In 2019, lawmakers started regulating the Internet of Things, especially network and device security. The most recent regulation frameworks impacting the IoT in Europe and the United States are summarised in the following table: Table 3.1: Regulatory Frameworks for IoT Security Region Cybersecurity EU The EU Cybersecurity Act Effective June 27 2019, and became law in the European Union and the UK. The NIS Directive (IoT infrastructure) became effective May 24 2018, in the EU and the UK. Each country will have to pass a law. USA The IoT Cybersecurity Improvement Act of 2020, signed on December 4 2020. The bill gives NIST, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the authority to manage IoT cybersecurity risks for devices acquired by the federal government. California The California IoT cybersecurity law SB-327 became effective on January1,2020 83 3.44 The EU Cybersecurity Act came into force on 27th June 2019, and became law in the EU and the UK . The Act strengthens the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA) mandate to help Member States address cybersecurity threats. ENISA is developing cybersecurity certification framework that the European Commission will validate. The European Cybersecurity Certification Framework will enable the issuance of cybersecurity certificates and statements of conformity for ICT products, services, and processes. They will be recognized in all EU Member States. Initially, manufacturers and vendors will be able to have their products and services meet the EU cybersecurity standards voluntarily. The certification may eventually be made mandatory. Compliant IoT devices will undoubtedly be labelled. In the long run, consumers and businesses may favour these compliant products and services. 3.45 In September 2022 , The European Union has proposed a cybersecurity regulation called “Cyber Resilience Act ” (CRA)39, which is a positive step towards standardizing security measures and protocols for digital products, especially for IoT. The Cyber Resilience Act has a few key factors which makes it crucial for IoT development and security. i. Part one (Manufacturing) - The Act specifies that any digital products (including connected devices for IoT) be manufactured in a secure manner. ii. Part two (Distribution) - Even if a product is designed to be secure, vulnerabilities and backdoors can always be introduced to them at a later stage. The Act specifies the need to deliver the products safely. iii. Part three (Access) - The Act also underlines the need for access management by appropriate control mechanisms, including but not limited to authentication, identity or access management systems. iv. Part four (Data Protection) - The CRA doubles down on EU’s GDPR requirements for data protection, and asks of device manufacturers to only 39 https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/cyber-resilience-act 84 collect data which is relevant and store, transmit, or process this data with extreme caution. v. Part five (Defensive security) - The most important detail in the CRA are the security requirements, whic h ask all digital elements to have the ability to avoid attacks, limit them in case they occur, or fight them off. It also includes logging and patching requirements. Thus, CRA expects ALL data to be handled with utmost importance and caution, not just personal data. This is what sets the CRA apart from GDPR. Also, it is important to note that any violations in regard to data protection will invoke heavy penalties for both GDPR and CRA for IoT device providers. 3.46 The UK has just passed the “ Product Security and Telecommunications Infrastructure Act 2022”40 , effective on or before 6th May2023. First part of this Act will help ensure that all consumer smart products have good security to protect against cyber-attacks. The new UK legislation covers the following three main security requirements: i. Consumer IoT devices will not be allowed to have universal default passwords. This makes it easier for consumers to configure their devices",

The new UK legislation covers the following three main security requirements: i. Consumer IoT devices will not be allowed to have universal default passwords. This makes it easier for consumers to configure their devices securely to prevent them being hacked by cyber criminals. ii. Consumer IoT devices will have to have a vulnerability disclosure policy . This means manufacturers must have a plan for how to deal with weaknesses in software which means it’s more likely that such weaknesses will be addressed properly. iii. Consumer IoT devices will need to disclose how long they will receive software updates. This means that software updates are created and released to maintain the security of the device throughout its declared lifespan. The duties of various entities like manufacturers, distributers, importers etc. 40 https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2022/46/contents/enacted 85 have been defined. The person responsible for enforcing the provisions of this Part, and of regulations made under it, is the Secretary of State . Failure to compliance could result in heavy monetary penalties. 3.47 In United States, there is neither a national IoT cybersecurity regulatory framework nor a comprehensive set of standards. In 2019, the IoT Cybersecurity Improvement Act was introduced and the bill was passed on December 4 2020. This act sets minimum security standards for IoT devices procured by the federal government. The private sector has been left unregulated. The act gives the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) the authority to oversee IoT cybersecurity risks for equipment bought by the federal government. Specifica lly, the text mandates NIST to issue guidelines dealing with security development, identity management, upgrade, and configuration management for IoT products. The bill also calls upon IoT device manufacturers to adopt coordinated vulnerability disclosure policies. 3.48 California legislature passed a new IoT security law41 in 2018 that became effective on January 1, 2020. This is the first IoT -specific security law in the country. It defines new security requirements for IoT devices connected directly or indir ectly to the Internet with an IP or Bluetooth address. It requires that these devices sold in California be fitted with “reasonable security features.” The security features should protect the IoT device and its data. But California’s IoT law is a signific ant first step as it targets IoT devices and basic cyber -attack methods that can leave consumers vulnerable to security and privacy risks. This act places liability on the IoT vendors if the device is connected to the Internet in California. Oregon also joined California with a similar text that went into effect on January 1 2020. 41 https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB327 86 Initiatives taken in India 3.49 TRAI in its recommendations on “Spectrum, Roaming and QoS related requirements in Machine-to-Machine Communications”, released in September 2017, had also mentioned the following requirements which have been accepted by DoT: i. Device manufacturers should be mandated to implement “Security by design” principle in M2M devices manufacturing so that end to end encryption can be achieved. ii. A National Trust Center (NTC), under the aegis of TEC, should be created for the certification of M2M devices and applications (hardware and software). 3.50 As per “Framework of Nataional Trust Centre for M2M/IoT Devices and Applications (TEC 31188:2022) R1.0” released by TEC in March 2022, These recommendations were accepted by DoT and it was also decided that for certification of software products & applications related to M2M devices, STQC (Standardization Testing and Quality Certification) under MeitY (Min istry of Electronics and Information Technology) may be the agency to carry out such testing under single window of proposed National Trust Centre”. Whereas, testing and Certification of IoT devices hardware is already covered in Essential Requirements (ER s) under MTCTE having testing specifications related to EMC, Safety, communication interfaces, IP, SAR and Security. Security specifications is being prepared in ITSAR (Indian telecom security assurance requirements). 3.51 IoT device hardware will be tested as per Mandatory Testing and Certification of Telecommunication Equipment ( MTCTE) Essential requirement (ER) prepared by TEC, and the software by STQC. MTCTE is already in progress and being implemented in phased manner to cover the telecom equipment and the devices. TEC has also released",

MTCTE is already in progress and being implemented in phased manner to cover the telecom equipment and the devices. TEC has also released guidelines “Code of practice for securing Consumer IoT ” to help in creating the ecosystem of secured devices and reducing vulnerabilities. However, no such specific trust centre for IoT devices appears to be functional under TEC or STQC 87 and no specific IoT related security testing specifications have been published till date. 3.52 Another bigger issue is most of the sectors using digital technologies or integrating emerging technologies do not have a digital risk element defined by the sectoral regulators till date. For example, the automotive sector is relying on IoT for connected vehicle s. The oil & gas market, nuclear, manufacturing and chemical industries are keen to leverage IoT to manage supply chains, improve efficiency and reduce costs. However, a key challenge faced by these sectors is securing the Internet of things. And, in this regard, no policy, standard or governance framework exists in India so far. 3.53 The Indian healthcare ecosystem is steadily moving towards smart medical devices, digital operation theatres and digital pharmacies, however, there is no call for standardisation from regulatory bodies such as NABH to safeguard Indian healthcare industry from cyber -attacks. Even though the new, advanced, medical equipment deployed in hospitals today are IoT enabled, and a majority of them are imported in India, apparently, there is no baseline criteria, labelling scheme available to test the security of these IoT-enabled medical devices. 3.54 IoT, today, has larger consequences for industry, and hence multiple government department and sectoral regulators need to work collaboratively on IoT Security. While many of the working groups under these ministries talk to each other through common committees such as BIS/ LITD, a common arrangement defining and allocating areas of responsibility and ownership is clearly missing. In view of this, the issue which needs to be deliberated by the stakeholders is: Q.8. What additional measures are required to strengthen the National Trust Centre (NTC) framework for complete security testing and certification of IoT devices (hardware as well as software) un der DoT / TEC. What modifications in roles and responsibilities are required to make NTC more effective? Kindly provide your comments with 88 justification in line with the global best practices Q.9. IoT security challenges and requirements vary significantly acr oss different industry verticals. Is there a need to develop sector-specific IoT security and privacy guidelines? Q.10. If answer to Q.9 is yes, is there a need for a common framework and methodology for developing such sector-specific guidelines? E. Privacy 3.55 The rapid rise of the Internet of Things (IoT) raises pressing privacy concerns despite its possible benefits. IoT devices can collect vast quantities of granular data about individuals’ daily habits and activities. The data that these devices can collect include consumption rate data, location data, and health -related data, among other things. IoT devices can be used by various entities to colonize and obtain access to people’s homes and bodies while compromising their anonymity. This possible corporate colonization and surveillance may limit individuals’ ability to determine what happens to their information and may decrease their ability to shield themselves, their emotions and their daily activities from various actors. The lack of a comprehensiv e privacy legislation may lead to regulatory gaps. There is a need to adopt comprehensive privacy and security legislation that provides baseline privacy rights to consumers by providing guidance on permissible and impermissible data practices and additional protections for sensitive data, such as biometric identifiers. International Experience 3.56 The most recent regulatory frameworks impacting the IoT privacy are summarised in the following table: Table 3.2: Regulatory Frameworks for IoT Privacy Region Consumer Data Privacy EU The General Data Protection Regulation (EU GDPR Directive 95/46/EC) effective May 25 2018, became law in the EU and the UK. 89 USA No comprehensive federal law regulating the collection and use of personal information yet.

It is followed in all member countries of the EU and UK. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is the toughest privacy and security law in the world. Though it was drafted and passed by the European Union (EU), it imposes obligations onto organizations anywhere, so long as they target or collect data related to people in the EU. The regulation was put into effect on May 25, 2018. The GDPR lev ies harsh fines against those who violate its privacy and security standards, with penalties reaching into the tens of millions of euros. All entities processing data must obey the following seven protection and accountability principles: i. Lawfulness, fairness, and transparency — Processing must be lawful, fair, and transparent to the data subject. ii. Purpose limitation — Data must be processed for the legitimate purposes specified explicitly to the data subject when it is collected. iii. Data minimization —Only as much data should be collected and processed as absolutely necessary for the purposes specified. iv. Accuracy — Personal data must be kept accurate and up to date. v. Storage limitation — Only personally identifying data may be stored for as long as necessary for the specified purpose. 42 https://gdpr.eu/what-is-gdpr/ 90 vi. Integrity and confidentiality — Processing must be done in such a way as to ensure appropriate security, integrity, and confidentiality (e.g. by using encryption). vii. Accountability — The data controller is responsible for being able to demonstrate GDPR compliance with all of these principles. 3.58 US has no “GDPR -like,” comprehensive federal law regulating the collection and use of personal information. Instead, it has a combination of federal and state laws and regulations that can sometimes overlap or contradict one another. Also, some industry sectors and their related markets are restricted by specific US laws. For example, the healthcare technology industry has its requirements in the United States, as defined in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 43 (HIPAA) and the Federal Exchange Data Breach Notification Act of 2015.44 HIPAA specifies national standards for the privacy and protection of healthcare information. This means that devices that may have access to that information, including the Internet of Medical Things, must protect their data and report if their security is breached. Another primary legislation from the 90s, the Gramm -Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) 45, is a banking and financial law with crucial data privacy and security requirements. 3.59 The California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) 46 toughens the privacy requirements and brings California more in line with the GDPR. It creates a new state agency—the California Privacy Protection Agency. Previously, the state's attorney general dealt with consumer privacy is sues on top of all their other responsibilities. The dedicated agency with a $10 million basic budget, in addition to part of the fines and settlements it collects from companies that break the law.

Initiatives taken in India 3.60 As India moves towards a digitally empowered economy, there is a growing concern about data privacy and protection of personal information. The government, along with various stakeholders, is taking steps to address the challenges of data privacy in the digital age . Through the use of IoT and associated devices, large quantities of personal data and sensitive personal data in certain cases, are exchanged. In most of these cases, the storage of the data is done in clouds. Therefore, data stored in a cloud service and not protected adequately may result in unauthorized third - party access and information leaks, who may use and process it for unwarranted purposes. Hence, there is a need to ensure that the personal data of individuals is protected and respected in accordance with the constitutional values and international standards. Government Initiatives 3.61 The Supreme Court of India recognized the Right to Privacy as a fundamental Right covered within the ambit of Right to life and personal liberty under Article 21.47 The sharing or receiving of personal information in spoken, writing, or electronic form is not protected by a stand -alone legislation in India. Although there are safeguards, they are spread over a variety of Laws, regulations, and policies. IT Act, 2000 (Amendment in 2008), herein after called IT Act and IT Sensitive Personal Data or Information Rules of 2011 , herein after called SPDI Rules , are the most significant legislations. 3.62 Section 43A of IT Act, states that : “Where a body corporate, possessing, dealing or handling an y sensitive personal data or information in a 47 vbcvcbcvc 92 computer resource which it owns, controls or operates, is negligent in implementing and maintaining reasonable security practices and procedures and thereby causes wrongful loss or wrongful gain to any person, such body corporate shall be liable to pay damages by way of compensation, not exceeding five crore rupees, to the person so affected..” 3.63 As per Sec 72A of IT Act, the punishment for disclosure of information in breach of Lawful contract and any person may be punished with imprisonment for a term not exceeding three years, or with a fine not exceeding up to five lakh rupees, or with both, in case disclosure of the information is made in breach of Lawful contract.” Punishment for it is stated in Sec 72. It says that: “any person who, in pursuance of any of the powers conferred under the IT Act Rules or Regulations made thereunder, has secured access to any electronic record, book, register, correspondence, information, document or other material without the consent of the person concerned, discloses such electronic record, book, register, correspondence, information, document or other material to any other person, shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to two years, or with fine which may extend to one lakh rupees, or with both.” Anyone who commits an offense or violation outside of India shall be held to the same standards as anyone who commits an offense or violation in India. This is stated in Section 75 of the Act. 3.64 The Indian gov ernment established a Committee of Experts, headed by Justice B.N. Srikrishna, to investigate Data Privacy problems in India . This report and draft Personal Data Protection Bill were given to Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology in July 2018 after the white paper’s open consultation. Expert Committee suggestions and stakeholder input were used to draft Personal Data Protection Bill 2019. In August 2022, Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology ( MeitY) had withdrawn Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019, owing to multiple recommendations received through public consultation. As revised version of its predecessor, the Government has formulate d new Digital 93 Personal Data Protection Bill in November, 2022. The new bill called “Digital Personal Data Protection Bill, 2023”, was passed by the parliament on 9th August 202348 and Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 came into effect from 11th August 2023. 3.65 As per section 3 of this Act, it shall (a) apply to the processing of digital personal data within the territory of India where the personal data is collected in digital form; or in non -digital form and digitised subsequently.

Consent may not be required for specified legitimate uses such as voluntary sharing of data by the individual or processing by the State for permits, licenses, benefits, and services. Data fiduciaries will be obligated to maintain the accuracy of data, keep data secure, and delete data once its purpose has been met or consent has been withdrawn by the individual. 3.67 The Act grants certain rights to individuals including the right to obtain information, seek correction and erasure, and grievance redressal. The central government may exempt government agencies from the application of provisions of the Bill in the interest of specified grounds such as security of the state, public order, and prev ention of offences. The central government will establish the Data Protection Board of India to adjudicate on non-compliance with the provisions of the Act. TRAI’s Recommendation on “Privacy, Security and Ownership of Data in the Telecom Sector” 48 https://pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID=1947264 94 3.68 In the backdrop of possible threats to the data privacy of the telecommunication consumers, the Authority released its recommendations49 dated 16th July, 2018 on “Privacy, Security and Ownership of Data in the Telecom Sector” . The Recommendations proposed consent mechanisms with varying levels of granularity in choices to be provided to the users by the service providers. Such choices are to be explicitly presented to the user before any data is collected. It is also recommended that the users be provided w ith appropriate notices detailing the practises regarding personal information being collected. Examples of such practises include purpose of collection and its intended use, and whether the personal data which is collected will be shared with a third party. Individual consent may be obtained only after providing the notice. 3.69 In this recommendation, it was emphasized that Notice, Choice, and Consent are the most important rights that should be given to the data consumers. Such notices should include disclosu res on what personal information is being collected; purpose for collection and its use; whether it will be disclosed to third parties; notification in case of data breach, etc. Similarly, Choice and Consent implies that a data controller shall give individuals choices (opt-in/opt-out) with regard to providing their personal information and take individual consent only after providing notice of its information practices. Consent may be considered to be a powerful means of protecting an individual’s informat ion. An individual is best placed to decide the sensitivity of his/her information rather than the Government or any other agency deciding it on his behalf. 3.70 Regarding issues related to consent management and Account Aggregators, the Authority recommended that “(a) The Right to Choice, Notice, Consent, Data Portability, and Right to be 49https://www.trai.gov.in/sites/default/files/RecommendationDataPrivacy16072018_0.pdf 95 Forgotten should be conferred upon the telecommunication consumers. (b) In order to ensure sufficient choices to the users of digital services, granularities in the consent mechanism should be built -in by the service providers. (c) For the benefit of telecommunication users', a framework, on the basis of the Electronic Consent Framework developed by MeitY and on lines of the master direction for data fiduciary (account aggregator) issued by Reserve Bank of India, should be notified for telecommunication sector also. It should have provisions for revoking the consent, at a later date, by users.” 3.71 The issue of Account Aggregator and Electronic Consent Framework was also deliberated in the recommendations as follows: “Subsequent to the development of the Electronic Consent Framework by MeitY, RBI, on behalf of all the Financia l Sector Regulators, has issued the master direction known as the \"Non-Banking Financial Company - Account Aggregator (Reserve Bank) Directions, 2016\" for all the Financial",

It has the concept of the data fiduciary (Account aggregator) that, after obtaining the consent of the customers electronically, collects the information from providers of information based on the standardized consent artifact and securely transmits the same to users of the information. This direction is for the benefit of financial sector consumers, as it empowers them to use their personal data, in the form of financial transactions history, for availing new services from any other competing service provider.” 3.72 In view of the above discussions, the following issue arises for consultation with stakeholders : Q.11. Please suggest regulatory and policy interventions required to ensure privacy of the massive amount of sensitive user data generated by IoT applications specifically in light of the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 . Kindly provide justification s along with the global best practices. 96 F. Startup ecosystem and Research & Development 3.73 Agricultural startups in India have been gaining immense popularity in recent years as they aim to modernize and improve the traditional agricultural sector in the country. The majority of the farmers in India are small and marginal, and the agricultural sector faces challenges such as low productivity, inadequate infrastructure, and limited access to technology and financing. The startups are using innovative technologies, financial services, and improved supply chain systems to improve the efficiency and profitability of Indian agriculture. With their continued growth and expansion, the agricultural sector in India has the potential to become one of the leading agricultural producers in the world, providing numerous economic and social benefits to the country and its people. 3.74 The Centre of Excellence (CoE) for IoT 50 (MeitY, NASSCOM, ERNET initiative) was announced by Hon’ble in July 2015 as a part of Digital India Initiative to help the IoT start up ecosystem. The program has done well since its inception and has created strong start -ups ecosystem. The major achievements of program are - 80 Start -ups enrolled in house, connected with 1075 start -ups pan India , 100 IoT research centres incubated, 66 Prototypes showcased , 23 Papers presented in global conferences, IP’s applied (post incubation start) -19, Received - 5, 34 societal projects executed, Funds raised by startups - Rs. 118 Cr. 3.75 The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MEITY) and innovation ecosystem THub is financially supporting s tartups in the hardware and internet of things (IoT) sectors for Digital India’s Scale Up programme. MeitY in partnership with NASSCOM had initiated a program to setup Centre of Excellences in IoT throughout the country. The objective of these CoEs in IoT is to promote the development and adoption of innovative solutions in the field of IoT. These are being setup in PPP model with contribution from MeitY, State Governments and rest from Industry. 50 https://ernet.in/projects/iot.html 97 3.76 The Authority in its recommendations on “Auction of Spectrum in frequency bands identified for IMT/5G ” dated 11 th April 2022 took cognisance of involving the startups in the development of use cases of digital technologies like 5G, IoT, M2M, AI etc. It recommended that: a. A 5G -dedicated Inter -Ministerial Working Group (IMWG), under the chairmanship of Member (Techn ology), DoT should be formed comprising Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Department of Space, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Education, Department of Science & Technology, Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) and Niti Ayog as members, which should be represented by JS Level officers. b.

The Digital Cell may also need to focus on issues relating to digital literacy, connectivity and affordable user devices for their sector. d. The Ministries/Departments should take up short -term (annual), medium - term (5 -year), and long -term (10 -year) plans with quantitative targets in respect of sector specific 5G use cases and the same can be considered by 98 IMWG for consistent and coordinated development of use cases and start - up ecosystems to align issues such as connectivity, privacy, data security etc. in the country. e. The participating members of IMWG should be responsible for outlining strategies, defining targets, and budgetary provisions for achieving defined targets for their respective Ministries / Departments. f. The IMWG should conduct periodic meetings and discussions, at least once in 3 months, in which progress achieved will be reviewed and outline path for achieving planned objectives will be framed. g. The IMWG should present consolidated status/proposals to the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) being nodal Ministry,on a regular basis. h. The progress of digital transformation and implementation of 5G use cases in various verticals should also be monitored and documented by IMWG and be submitted to DoT for perusal and appropriate decision. 3.77 Recently, a team of officers from TRAI visited one such NASSCOM Centre of Excellence – IoT & AI at Bengaluru, a joint initiative of Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY), Govt. of India and Govt. of Karnataka, Haryana, Gujarat, A.P and NASSCOM. The CoE has provided extensive workstation spaces to Start -ups within its facility. Apart from that it also provides them with required lab facilities, tools, bandwidth etc. It helps them raise funds from investors, connects them with mentors, experts and enterprises for their development and growth. Some of the innovative projects being undertaken by startups here include i) Medical training simulator named as Fertilator, for assisted IVF procedures, which is also useful for skill -upgradation of Infertologists, Gynaecologists & Embryologists. ii) Quantum computing projects, next generation superconductivity based products such as motors, high temperature qubits, material discovery using Quantum and AI based discovery engine. iii)End-to-end testing in a manufacturing facility using AI. 99 iv) App based Electric Vehicle Charging stations to be installed in Malls, Apartment complexes. v) Automated machines to provide batter for food industry with right mix of ingredients, temperature and other controls. vi) use cases built around Drones. 3.78 During this visit it was found that the startups are facing certain challenges. One of the main challenges is importing the equipment for R&D purposes and it was felt that an institutional framework is required to provide assistance in procurement of such equipment. They are also facing the issue of warehousing requirements. Several test equipments are required by them, which are quite costly and require regular Opex for their calibration and maintenance. The Start-ups need regular interface with experts, mentors and other enterpises to develop and improve upon their projects. While CoE has partnered with several industry organisations, this needs to be further strengthened. Some Start-ups may require access to large computing power which may not be readily available within CoE. They need to tap this computing power through Cloud based solutions or other organisations providing compute power on demand. Another significant challenge being faced by them is the access to high and reliable bandwidth. They also need market access with the help of industry to help them scale their work for commercial deployment. These startups are also not well aware about patent and other IPR laws and filing procedures. 3.79 In view of above discussions, the",

What additional policy and regulatory measures are required to encourage research and development of IoT use cases in various sectors? Is there a need to incentivize startups for research and development of IoT enabled use cases in various industry verticals? If yes, kindly suggest measures for the same. Q.13. What measures should be taken to encourage centres of excellence to handhold startups working in the development of use cases and 100 applications in 5G and beyond technologies? How can the domestic and foreign investors be encouraged to invest for funding the startups for these kinds of development activities? G. Legal Framework 3.80 IoT has many potential benefits for various sectors such as agriculture, healthcare, education, transportation and more. However, IoT also poses significant challenges and risks. One of the major challenges is the liability for damages caused by IoT devices or applications. For example, who should be held responsible if a smart car causes an accident, or if a medical device malfunctions and harms a patient, or if a smart home device leaks personal data to unauthorized parties? Whether the current legal framework in India provides clear and consistent answers to these questions, and able to account for the specific features and implications of IoT. 3.81 There is a need for a clear allocation of roles and responsibilities among the various stakeholders involved in IoT, such as manufacturers, service providers, consumers, regulators and third parties. Creating liability regimes in the world of IoT is another challenging task considering the number of actors from internet providers, device manufacturers to app service providers. Compromising of any one of these devices or networks would create havoc. Finding ways to impute liability in a confusing world of diverse actors will have to be explored. A s pecific and effective mechanism for redressal and compensation for damages caused by IoT devices or applications may also be required. However, conceiving new laws or evolving existing ones is a daunting task. Therefore, the stakeholders’ response is solicited on the following question: Q.14. Whether there is a need to make changes in relevant laws to handle various issues, including liability regime and effective mechanism for redressal and compensation in case of accidents, damages, or 101 malfunctions involving IoT, drones, or robotic systems . If yes, give detailed suggestions. IV. Edge Computing for 5G enabled IoT Applications 3.82 Edge computing creates opportunities to enhance digital experiences, improve performance and security in 5G ecosystem . Edge computing brings computation and data storage closer to the source of data generation. For example, in the context of the Internet of Things (IoT), the sources of data generation are usually things with sensors or embedded devices. Edge computing allows storing, processing, and analyzing data locally instead of just sending it to a centralized server. (See Figure 3.1) From there, the processed data can be delivered to its destination sooner. Edge computing reduces the cascade of potential bandwidth b ottlenecks and processes the data that matters, keeping it close to the source . The major benefit of this is reduced network traffic and latency along with improved efficiency. Another advantage is the better compliance to law of the land, wherein the data protection regulation may require to process and store certain data locally. 3.83 Enterprises, cloud service providers, and telecom companies are investing heavily in digital edge data center to boost the speed of applications like streaming video, telemedicine, factory automation, etc. In addition, these data center types enable new technologies like augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR) and autonomous vehicles. Gartner estimates that by 2025, 75 percent of data will be processed outside the traditional data center or cloud.51 51https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/what-edge-computing-means-for- infrastructure-and-operations-leaders/ 102 Figure 3.2 : Edge Computing in IoT Use Cases Source : IEEE innovation at work Edge Computing Use Cases 3.84 Prime use cases, which take full advantage of edge technology, include: i.

Autonomous Vehicles: The decision to stop for a pedestrian crossing in front of an autonomous vehicle (AV) must be made immediately. Relying on a remote server to handle this decision is not reasonable. Additionally, vehicles that utilize edge technology can interact more efficiently because they can co mmunicate with each other first as opposed to sending data on accidents, weather conditions, traffic, or detours to a remote server first. Edge computing can help. ii. Healthcare Devices: Health monitors and other wearable healthcare devices can keep an eye on chronic conditions for patients. It can save lives by instantly alerting caregivers when help is required. Additionally, robots assisting in surgery must be able to quickly analyze data in order 103 to assist safely, quickly, and accurately. If these devices rely on transmitting data to the cloud before making decisions, the results could be fatal. iii. Security Solutions: Because it’s necessary to respond to threats within seconds, security surveillance systems can also benefit from edge computing technology. Security systems can identify potential threats and alert users to unusual activity in real-time. iv. Retail Advertising: Targeted ads and information for retail organizations are based on key parameters, such as demographic information, set on field devices. In t his use case, edge computing can help protect user privacy. It can encrypt the data and keep the source rather than sending unprotected information to the cloud. v. Smart Speakers: Smart speakers can gain the ability to interpret voice instructions locally in order to run basic commands. Turning lights on or off, or adjusting thermostat settings, even if internet connectivity fails would be possible. vi. Video Conferencing: Poor video quality, voice delays, frozen screens — a slow link to the cloud can cause many video conferencing frustrations. By placing the server -side of video conferencing software closer to participants, quality problems can be reduced. A. MEC Security 3.85 When it comes to the security of MEC, it may appear at first sight that it is more secure because data is not travelling over the network. However, the flip side of it is that it is less secure because the edge devices in themselves can be more vulnerable. Edge applications relating to IoT pose special security risks because IoT devices are designed for low cost, low power usage and deployment to areas often not suitable for complex technology because of conditions in the environment where they're deployed, such as temperature and humidity, dust or vibration. These risks include the use of specialized IoT protocols, which normally lack sophisticated security features such as encryption; wireless interfaces 104 such as Wi-Fi, which could be subject to hacking or hijacking because of easy access to the area where the Wi -Fi hubs are installed; and IoT gateways not being upgraded with proper security software. 3.86 Edge computing exposes data to more potential threats and vulnerabilities, as data is stored and processed on devices that may have lower security standards or capabilities than centralized cloud servers. Data controllers and processors need to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect the data at the edge from unauthorized or accidental disclosure, alteration, or loss. To address these regulatory challenges, edge computing stakeholders need to adopt a risk- based approach that considers the nature, scope, context, and purpose of the data processing at the edge. They also need to collaborate with regulators and policymakers to develop clear and consistent frameworks and guidelines that balance the benefits and risks of edge computing for data protection, privacy, and security. 3.87 In view of the above discussions, the inputs of stakeholders are so licited on the following issue: Q.15.

MEC Environmental Concerns 3.88 The importance of data centres has risen substantially over the last decade as people are getting more and more inclined towards digital lives. They are the backbone of the Internet. The nature of data centre demand appears likely to evolve over the coming decade. 5G, the Internet of things and the metaverse are likely to increase demand for low-latency computing i.e. edge computing. According to a market research52, the edge computing market size is expected to grow from USD 44.7 billion in 2022 to USD 52https://www.researchandmarkets.com/reports/5668996/edge-computing-market-by- component-hardware 105 101.3 billion by 2027, at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 17.8% during the forecast period (See fig. 3.3). Figure 3.3: Global Edge computing Market Source : ResearchAndMarkets 3.89 Data centre s are one of the most energy -intensive buildings having a significant impact on the environment and their sustainability has become an important topic in recent years . Global data centre electricity use in 2021 was 220 -320 TWh53, or around 0.9 -1.3% of global final electricity demand. This figure is only going to increase as the demand for cloud computing (inc luding edge) grows. In some countries, data centres will account for an estimated 5 -10% of energy consumption by 2030 .54 Similarly, the data centres and data transmission networks that underpin digitalisation accounted for around 300 Mt CO2-eq in 2020 55 (including embodied emissions), equivalent to 0.9% of energy-related GHG emissions (or 0.6% of total GHG emissions). 3.90 Major digital operators are implementing a significant push to reduce the energy consumption of all data centre components to mitigate th eir growing environmental impact. Huge efforts have already been made by a number of industry players to reduce the environmental impact of data centres. For example, the Climate Neutral Data Centre Pact 56 is a 53 https://www.iea.org/reports/data-centres-and-data-transmission-networks#reference-2 54 https://stlpartners.com/articles/sustainability/edge-computing-sustainability/ 55 https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-L.1470-202001-I/en 56 https://www.climateneutraldatacentre.net/ 106 movement that sets forth a vision for climate neutrality of data centres in Europe by 2030 by addressing 5 efficiency metrics including 100% carbon free energy and water conservation. Some data centre providers seeking to minimise their footprint have already made significant headway, particularly with respect to reducing non-renewable energy consumption. International Experience 3.91 The European Union relies on the following instruments to ensure the energy-efficiency, climate -neutrality and overall sustainability of data centres.57 i. EU Code of Conduct for Data Centres was launched in 2008 with the aim of improving the energy efficiency in data centre . The Code of Conduct is a voluntary initiative, wh ich sets ambitious voluntary standards for companies willing to participate. The Code of Conduct identifies and focuses on key issues and agreed solutions, and best practices. ii. Servers and data storage products sold in the EU for data centres and server rooms of companies, are subject to rules laid out in the Regulation on eco-design requirements for servers and data storage products EU 2019/42458. The objective of the regulation is to limit the environmental impact of these products with a set of rules on e nergy efficiency, such as minimum efficiency of the power supply units and minimum server efficiency in active state, maximum consumption in idle state and information on the product operating temperature. iii. EU Green Public Procurement (GPP) Criteria is aimed at helping public authorities to ensure that data centres’ equipment and services are procured in such a way that they deliver environmental improvements . Three priority areas of focus are identified as the basis for criteria: 1) ICT System Performance, 2) Mechanical and electrical system performance, 3) Reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) Emissions. 57 https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/green-cloud 58https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legalcontent/EN/TXT/?qid=1553786820621&uri=CELEX%3A32019R0424 107 The European Commission is currently conducting a study to address the lack of commonly accepted definitions and methods to assess the energy- efficiency, clim ate-neutrality and overall sustainability of data centres: 'Greening cloud computing and electronic communications services and networks: towards climate neutrality by 2050'.59 3.92 IMDA Singapore has developed Green DC standard “SS 564”, which helps organisations establish systems and processes necessary to improve the energy efficiency of their DCs.

It provides them with a recognised framework as well as a logical and consistent methodology to achieve continuous improvement in their DC facilities. This standard is based on the “ISO 50001 ” standard on energy management but is specifically tailored to meet the needs of DCs in Singapore. In addition, the Green DC Standard defines a set of performance metrics for DCs to measure their energy efficiency. Th ese metrics provide a common benchmark to help DCs track their performance and improvements. It also includes a comprehensive set of recommended industry best practices covering various aspects of DC operations and design. 3.93 Malaysia has developed a technical code60, which provides the minimum requirements for green data centres . It helps in establishing policies, systems and processes to improve the energy efficiency of data centres and at the same time reducing the carbon footprint of the industry. This Technical Code also outlines the best practices that data centres should adopt in achieving a sustainable industry. This Technical Code covers all private and public data centres operating in Malaysia . Within a data centre, the following areas are covered namely environmental conditions, energy management, air management, cooling management, IT equipment 59https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/study-greening-cloud-computing-and- electronic-communications-services-and-networks-towards-climate 60https://www.mcmc.gov.my/skmmgovmy/media/General/pdf/MCMC- Green_Data_Centres.pdf 108 and lighting, power chain management, space management, information management, governance and guidelines. 3.94 Japanese Government has planned to set a target for the country to hit carbon neutrality by 2050 in line with EU . Japan’s New Energy an d Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO), through its $17 billion Green Innovation Fund61, aims to support the development of ‘next- generation green data center technology’ that will create energy savings of 40 percent or more compared to c urrent data centers. It will fund projects for greener and more efficient data centers including optoelectronics technology, power -saving CPUs, and cheaper silicon carbide semiconductors. The Japanese government has announced that it will subsidise 50% of the building costs towards new zero carbon - emissions data centres, and upgrades of existing facilities as part of a new $7.3bn initiative to innovate the industry and cut carbon emissions. 62 To reduce carbon-emissions and the amount of energy used in cooling of data centres, Japan is planning to build new facilities in its colder regions. 3.95 In the United States, green building rating system “Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) ” is used to certify the DCs as green DCs. This rating system has been d eveloped by the U.S. Green Building Council and is available in several categories like silver, gold or platinum certification. The platinum certification is given to data centers with the highest level of environmentally responsible construction and efficient use of resources.63 There is another certification programme for DCs called “National Data Centre Energy Efficiency Information Program” by Energy Star, part of an initiative by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Depar tment of Energy. The program certifies buildings and consumer products for energy efficiency. 61https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/japans-nedo-to-fund-new-green-data-center- research-projects/ 62 https://datacentremagazine.com/data-centres/japans-data-centres-go-green 63https://lifelinedatacenters.com/colocation/leed-certification-data-centers/ 109 3.96 Several vendors have released products and software that support green data centre initiatives.

Several major states have also notified their respective data centre policies and others have signed MoUs with private players to develop data centres. Due to these efforts, the installed data centre capacity of India in terms of floor space is expected to grow at a CAGR of 6.5% from 584,000 m2 in 2021 to 751,000 m2 by 2025. Figure 3.3: Indian Data Centre Market Source : ResearchAndMarkets 64https://www.researchandmarkets.com/reports/5312315/india-data-centre-landscape- 2021-to-2025 110 3.98 These policies, however, ignore a very pertinent issue with data centres , which is their environmental impact. Data centres affect the environment in two major ways electricity consumption and water usage. They are online 24/7 and require power back -up and a captive power source, as well as a substantial volume of water to stay cool. They often have a deleterious impact on nearby watersheds along with emissions issues arising from the disposal of cooling water and heat dissipation. 3.99 Most countries don’t require reporting of data centre -specific energy or environmental impact studies. The figures for India are also not available. But, the issue of the source of electricity is well known. At present, 59.1% of India’s electricity comes from fossil fuels, with 51% of that from coal. In states with the largest number of data centre projects, namely Maharashtra and Delhi NCR, some 78% 65 and 85 -90%66 of the total electricity generated is from fossil fuel sources, and mostly coal. It seems unlikely that this expansion can be achieved without serious reliance on coal and fossil fuel-powered electricity. 3.100 National Data Centre Policy 2020, which is still in draft stage, encourages the use of “solar or wind” energy for data centres and for reduction of carbon footprint, but it does not mandate the use of green energy or a minimum threshold for use of green energy. So any me asures to reduce the carbon footprint of data centres is at the initiative of the industry alone. The IGBC (Indian Green Building Council), a division of the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), provides a green data centr e accreditation consisting of v arious criteria and standards to assess efficiency and functioning of green data cent res. The IGBC green data center rating system 67 addresses priorities like reduction in energy demand and related infrastructure, saving water, use of renewable energy 65https://npp.gov.in/public-reports/cea/monthly/installcap/2021/DEC/capacity2-Western- 2021-12.pdf 66 https://npp.gov.in/public-reports/cea/monthly/installcap/2021/DEC/capacity2-Northern- 2021-12.pdf 67 https://igbc.in/igbc/redirectHtml.htm?redVal=showgreendataenrenosign 111 resources, waste segregation and proper disposal, aiming to create new benchmarks amid national standards and codes. 3.101 In continuation of several initiatives to promote clean and green energy by Government of India, the Ministry of Power has notified the Green Open Access Rules, 2022 in which it has reduced the open access transactions limit from 1 MW to 100 kW for green energy to enable small consumers to purchase renewable power through open access.68 As per these rules, any consumer with a connected load of 100 kW or above can get Renewable Energy through open access from any Renewable Energy generating plant set up by himself or by any developer. The application for open access can be made on a portal, which will allow consumers to access green power easily through transparent, simplified, uniform and streamlined procedure. Approval for Green Energy Open Access will be granted to a Consumer in a time bound manner within15 days. 3.102 The Authority in its Recommendations 69 dated 18th November 2022 on “Regulatory Framework for Promoting Data Economy Through Establishment of Data Centres, Content Delivery Networks, and Interconnect Exchanges in India ” has addressed th is issue and has envisioned that “the Indian Green Building Council (IGBC) along with Telecommunication Engineering Center (TEC) should be entrusted with task of framing certification standards of green DCs in India ”. In the same recommendations it has also been recommended that “Government should launch a scheme to incentivize (in the form of Government subsidy) implementation of innovative solutions and green initiatives by the DCs.

Availability of surplus power in Indian states and robust yet extensive fiberization is still insufficient to match global players. Thus, catching up on alternatives of renewable energy resources is a prerequisite . The Authority has further suggested that the rating system needs to be India- specific, pushing the requirement of national standards and codes to certify data cent res operating under prevalent conditions, for instance, codes and standards applied by the NBC (National Building Code), ECBC (Energy Conservation Building Code), guidelines issued by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC). 3.104 Another grave issue, which needs to be addressed is the use of water by data centres. They use water for cooling purposes . The data of data centres’ use of water is quite sparse. There is no law requiring the disclosure of water consumption by data centres, in the US or in India. Instead, examples of profligate water use only come to light due to disputes with local residents. For example, a major Google data centre in South Carolina, a water -deficit region, used up to 2. 4 billion litres 70 of water every year. The Ministry of Water Resources in India has estimated that a total of 17 trillion litres 71 of water was used in all the industrial areas in India. 70https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/analysis/data-center-water-usage-remains- hidden/ 71https://science.thewire.in/environment/hidden-environmental-costs-india-data-centre-push/ 113 3.105 According to World Bank, India has 18% of the world’s population, but only 4% of its water resources .72 The country has been facing water scarcity in nearly 21 major cities; the data hubs of Mumbai, Bengaluru, Delhi and Chennai are all likely to face major water crises, as per one NITI Aayog report. However, neither the draft National Data Centre Policy nor any of the extant state policies address the issue of water requirements of data centres. The absence of knowledge about the true cost of data centres in terms of water consumption means states continue to incentivise investments without asking for any data about water consumption – or the impact of such use on the water table and local residents. No laws mandate the use of sustainable water and conservation practices either. 3.106 The Authority in its Recommendations dated 18 th November 2022 on “Regulatory Framework for Promoting Data Economy Through Establishment of Data Centres, Content Delivery Networks, and Interconnect Exchanges in India ” has addressed this issue and has recommended mandatory rainwater harvesting and recy cling arrangements to be included in Data Centre buildings and parks. 3.107 As India’s own experience has shown, it is possible to conserve water and foster sustainable water use practices at scale . For electricity, it’s important to actualise the shift to renewable energy. These issues can be addressed with incentivising schemes to support the development of ‘next- generation green data center technology’ , the reporting norms, independent audits and proper planning. In the information economy of the 21st century, data centres present an incredible economic and strategic opportunity. However, it is important that we take the true costs of data centres into account and ensure that India’s dreams of data sovereignty do not come at the cost of its people and its environment. 72https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/india/brief/world-water-day-2022-how-india-is-addressing-its- water-needs 114 Chapter – 4 METAVERSE : OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES I.

Introduction 4.1 The metaverse is the key to the next wave of digital transformation . It creates an immersive space for interactions that are enabled by a range of technologies—including, but not limited to augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), extended reality (XR), artificial intelligence (AI), internet of things, and digital twins. It has the potential of creating a simulated real- life environment where people can talk, work, and play using specialized glasses, headsets, controllers, and related resources. The Metaverse is currently all the rage in the digital world because of its seemingly endless potential and objectives. Industry players and investors are overwhelmingly looking for new use cases and monetisation opportunities from metaverse. It is an environment where the physical and digital worlds can coexist and significantly impact fundamental areas of daily life. It is a universe of limitless, interconnected virtual communities where people can socialize, collaborate, and have fun using virtual reality headsets, augmented reality glasses, smartphone apps, and other technologies. 4.2 The metaverse is a term that refers to a shared virtual reality where people can interact with each other and with digital content across different platforms and devices. The metaverse has been envisioned as a potential future of the internet, wh ere immersive and social experiences are enhanced by technologies such as augmented reality, virtual reality, blockchain, artificial intelligence, and cloud computing. However, the metaverse also poses significant challenges for regulation, as it involves complex and novel issues such as data privacy, content moderation, intellectual property rights, digital identity, cybersecurity, taxation, competition, and governance. These issues require careful consideration and coordination among various stakeholders, such as governments, 115 businesses, civil society, and users. 4.3 Web3 and Metaverse allow users to own and control their digital assets. These assets are stored in decentralized wallets and stay under the total control of the users. Both Web 3.0 and Metaverse p rovide immersive experiences to their users. Web3 and Metaverse are community -driven systems. Web3 relies on the active participation of developers, users, and other stakeholders to build and maintain the decentralized web. Similarly, Metaverse relies on i ts community to create virtual experiences and applications, govern the platform and make decisions about its future direction. In fact, Web3 is used to access the Metaverse immersive experiences. This consultation paper deals with the issues related to Metaverse in detail, because ultimately this is going to be the user interface in Web3. 4.4 Web3 and Metaverse will play an important role in building the next version of the Internet and leading the next wave of digital adoption for Indian industries. According to a recent report73 released by Arthur D. Little, Web3 and Metaverse market opportunity in India is expected to grow at an annual growth rate of nearly 40%, with the potential to become a US $200 billion industry by 2035. This repo rt has also projected Metaverse to become a US $13 trillion opportunity globally by 2030. It is estimated that about 8% of the $160 trillion global GDP by 2030 will come from Web3 and Metaverse. India’s e -commerce penetration and its leadership in digital payments adoption presents an opportunity for Web3 and Metaverse technologies to enhance the retail and finance sectors. Investors, corporates, start-ups, government and regulators need to work together to help India realize the US $ 200 Bn potential in Web3 and Metaverse. 4.5 TRAI has organised various seminars and workshops on Metaverse to understand the subject and discuss the regulatory challenges involved in 73 Web3 and Metaverse could be US $ 200 Bn opportunity for India according to a new report released by Arthur D.

Another workshop on “Metaverse Introduction, Applications, and Upcoming challenges” was organised on 17th May 2023 in TRAI. With this background, the Authority has come out with certain policy and regulatory issues for consultation with the stakeholders to facilitate an orderly growth of Metaverse. II. Building Blocks of Metaverse Figure 4.1: Metaverse Stack Source : Level Up Coding 4.6 The Metaverse stack (See Figure 4.1) is broadly consists of 4 layers, each of which along with their subcategories are critical building blocks. This layered architecture of the Metaverse give an idea about how the various technological building blocks will fit together in the stack, and also about 117 its flow. However, this stack is just a reference for the time being and is evolving and dynamic due to various developments taking place rapidly in the metaverse landscape. 4.7 Layer 1 i.e., the infrastructure layer includes the technology that enables our devices, connects t hem to the network, and delivers content. It consists of network and hardware. A major component of this layer is a reliable, high bandwidth and low latency network connectivity. 5G networks have the capability to fulfil these requirements of bandwidth and latency. 6G will improve these capabilities by yet another order of magnitude. Another major component of this layer is hardware inside the end user devices like smartphones to VR/AR devices to haptic devices and display technologies. These devices will require increasingly powerful and miniaturized processors, tiny sensors and long-lasting batteries. 4.8 Layer 2 i.e., the virtualization engine layer provides the computational and programming platform for the metaverse. The Metaverse will have the greatest ongoing computational requirements in human history. The ever- expanding need for computing power and its scarcity will need to be addressed by a combination of Cloud computing, Local computing, Edge computing and Blockchain computing. This layer also consists of virtual platforms on top of which the content creators and developers will built the immersive digital contents. Another major component at this layer would be Avatars. Avatars are the embodiment of Metaverse users. They are a person’s identity in the Metaverse, allowing them to go on different adventures in different experiences. 4.9 Layer 3 i.e., Interface and Access layer helps users in accessing the Metaverse. It ranges from evolving smartphones to VR/AR headsets to future technologies like haptic devices and smart glasses. Smartphones are evolving towards absorbing more immersive applications and experiences from metaverse with further miniaturization , embedded AI technology and powerful sensors and low latency access to edge computing systems. Other Metaverse compatible devices include AR 118 glasses, VR headsets , haptic gloves, wrist bands, 3D-printed wearables, hologram displays, etc. 4.10 Layer 4 i.e., user experience and use cases layer is responsible for t he creation, sale, trading , storage, payment and financial management of digital assets like content, games, shopping malls, movies, etc. This layer contains all business and services , which is built specifically for the Metaverse, independent of virtual platforms. Users can buy and sell goods with the help of non -fungible tokens (NFTs). It supports digital payment processes and platforms, including cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether and other blockchain technologies. III. Critical Technological Components of Metaverse 4.11 Based on above discussions, we can say that the metaverse is technically complex since it is built from many technolog ical components . The technologies that are needed f or an effective metaverse deployment are discussed in the following sections. A. Extended Reality 4.12 Extended reality is an umbrella term for all digital and physical reality combinations. This includes augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR) and mixed reality (MR). 4.13 Augmented Reality (AR) is a form of extended reality that essentially overlays the metaverse onto the physical world. AR superimposes virtual content onto the real world allowing users to interact with virtual content while continuing to see the “real” environment around them.",

The technologies that are needed f or an effective metaverse deployment are discussed in the following sections. A. Extended Reality 4.12 Extended reality is an umbrella term for all digital and physical reality combinations. This includes augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR) and mixed reality (MR). 4.13 Augmented Reality (AR) is a form of extended reality that essentially overlays the metaverse onto the physical world. AR superimposes virtual content onto the real world allowing users to interact with virtual content while continuing to see the “real” environment around them. The use of AR can allow for additional information such as directions, video, internet pages and more to be available to users through the use of an app on their smartphone (or other AR technologies such as g lasses) in the real world. Augmented Reality can be used in multiple environments. AR use may help students become more engaged in the concept/topic at hand. Rather than just looking at the textbook, or watching a video, students can see the topic come to life in a 3D model through the use of the digital device. 119 By offering 3D visual representation and/or additional information, AR offers educators and students an opportunity to experience an engaging and hands on learning experience. 4.14 Virtual Reality provides users with the experience of engaging with the metaverse in an immersive fashion. VR technology, when paired with a headset, allows users to enter the virtual world . Fully immersive VR incorporates multiple senses to immerse users in the experience of a new reality fully. This includes sight, sound, and possibly even tactile feedback. Appropriate gear is used to stimulate each sense. This includes headsets, gloves, and goggles. A person is still present in the physical world when using VR, but interacting entirely with digital content. Surgeons have benefitted from the ability to practice their profession in a virtual environment. VR can provide visual and spatial simulation experiences by allowing the student to feel as though they are physically placed within the environment they are learning about. Figure 4.2 : Reality Spectrum 4.15 Mixed Reality (MR) is a blend of real world with virtual reality. In MR, users can interact and manipulate both physical and virtual objects using next generation sensing and imaging technologies . The experiences that can transition between augmented and virtual realities form mixed reality, where a user can place a digital object, such as a hologram, in the physical 120 world as if it were physically present. Or, the user may be personally and digitally present in the physical world, in the form of an avatar, to asynchronously collaborate with others at different points in time. B. Blockchain 4.16 Blockchain is a public digital ledger system that can be used for executing transactions, smart contracts, and othe r agreements. Its power relies upon its decentralized nature as every transaction is stored on a distributed database in different locations. It records transactions chronologically and transparently protecting privacy and ensuring the fidelity of the data . It was first introduced in crypto currency market to store the transactions. These transactions or records being stored as blocks, are linked together using hashing mechanisms . It ensures the ledgers ‘immutability’. In the context of the metaverse, blockchain paves the way for secure and decentralized transactions between users in the metaverse. The ability to create and own digital assets that can be traded and sold in the metaverse is another benefit of this technology. The metaverse eco-system relies on blockchain for accounting their content and transactions to ensure user integrity, privacy, and reputation. C. AI and Machine Learning 4.17 Machine learning (ML) and other forms of artificial intelligence are rapidly gaining ground as critical to ols for the development of intelligent and adaptive metaverse virtual environments. They can be utilized to make intelligent “characters” that interact with users, delivering a greater sense of life and personality to virtual environments. D. Cloud / Edge Computing 4.18 Cloud computing is just as vital as AI and ML for constructing the metaverse. Both the processing power and data storage for massive metaverses can be available in the cloud. In addition, consumers can use 121 the metaverse from any device, because of cloud connectivity. E. 5G Ecosystem: A necessity for Metaverse 4.19 Metaverse is envisioned as a seamless integration of the physical and digital worlds, where users can move between different platforms and devices without losing their identity or data.

E. 5G Ecosystem: A necessity for Metaverse 4.19 Metaverse is envisioned as a seamless integration of the physical and digital worlds, where users can move between different platforms and devices without losing their identity or data. To realize this vision, a high- speed, low-latency, and reliable network infrastructure is essential. 5G will be the first generation of networks to successfully support the Metaverse and make it feasible for digital words to operate because of its high reliabilit y, low latency, fast speed, and higher capacity. 5G is a necessity for the metaverse because it can provide the network performance, scalability, and flexibility that are required for a rich and realistic virtual world. 4.20 5G can enable immersive and interac tive experiences in the metaverse, such as high-definition video streaming, cloud gaming, augmented reality, and virtual reality. 5G can also support massive connectivity of devices and sensors, enabling the creation of smart environments and digital twins that mirror the physical world. 5G can also enhance the experience of users in the metaverse, by providing a dedicated end-to-end network resource using network slicing. 5G can unlock the full potential of the metaverse and enable new possibilities for innovation, collaboration, and entertainment. F. Non-fungible Tokens (NFTs) 4.21 Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are unique and verifiable digital assets that can be stored on a blockchain, a distributed ledger that ensures security and transparency. NFTs have a significant role to play in the metaverse. NFTs allow users to own and trade their digital creations and collections in the metaverse. NFTs encourage artists and creators to produce original and diverse content for the metaverse, as they can mo netize their work and reach a global audience. NFTs also facilitate social and economic exchange, as users can join communities, participate in events, and 122 access platforms and services related to NFTs. NFTs are therefore essential for the development and growth of the metaverse, as they provide a way to create, own, and enjoy digital assets in a decentralized and secure way. IV. Evolution of Metaverse 4.22 In the 1970s, MIT created the Aspen Movie Map, which enabled users to take a computer-generated tour of the town of Aspen, Colorado. This was the first time VR was used to transport users to another place. Metaverse made its first appearance only in 1992 when Neil Stevenson highlighted the concept of virtual reality through the cha racters of his novel ‘Snow Crash.’ Further in the early 90s, a firm called Sega launched VR gaming solutions such as SEGA VR -1 to offer immersive gaming experience to players in arcades. All these inventions can be seen as the starting push for the thriving Metaverse industry we are seeing today.74 4.23 In 2014, Sony and Samsung both announced they were creating their own VR headsets, and Google released its first Cardboard device and Google Glass AR glasses. Google’s Cardboard device is a low -cost cardboard VR viewer for smartphones. Microsoft’s HoloLens headsets hit the market in 2016, which provided mixed reality (AR and VR) experience for the first time. With HoloLens, we can create a holographic image in front of us, then put it into the real world and manipulate it using augmented reality. Also in 2016, the Pokémon GO augmented reality game gained immense popularity. 4.24 Swedish furniture giant IKEA joined the metaverse mix in 2017 with their innovative Place app, which allows its consumers to select a piece of furniture and view how it looks like in their home or office. In 2020, Apple added Lidar (Light Detection and Ranging) to iPhones and iPads, creating better depth scanning for better photos and AR, and also paving the way for mixed-reality headsets in the future. Metaverse was growing slowly and steadily, but the technology became the buzzword, when Facebook 74 Forbes: A short history of Metaverse 123 changed its name to ‘Meta’ in 2021 in a bid to show its newly developed focus in the sector. 4.25 The scope of Metaverse is expanding quickly. Where earlier it was limited to gaming projects, today the technology has become an inevitable part of multi-billion-dollar worth industrial realms. Its application is widely appreciated",

Where earlier it was limited to gaming projects, today the technology has become an inevitable part of multi-billion-dollar worth industrial realms. Its application is widely appreciated in the sports sector, entertainment world, business field, etc. Global music brands and producers are shifting to Metaverse for hosting concerts and interacting with fans. Popular sports clubs like Manchester City are building virtual stadiums for sports lovers to enjoy their favourite matches from the comfort of their homes. 4.26 Metaverse offers opportunities for brands and celebrities to launch their official merchandise for fans to purchase. A metaverse -based shopping mall has been opened by Middle East lifestyle and leisure conglomerate Majid al Futtaim.75 The Mall of the Metaverse is based in the Decentraland platform and will offer \"increased digital experiences across retail, entertainment and leisure offerings\". V. Metaverse Use Cases 4.27 Various industry verticals across the world have already deployed the metaverse use cases and are getting benefitted out of that. Even more promising use cases will be seen in time to come. Some current and potential use cases of metaverse technology are discussed below. A. Healthcare 4.28 Metaverse has enormous potential for the healt hcare industry. The growing use of VR in medical education, the application of AR in surgery, the use of gamification to link hospital personnel and patients, and other metaverse components are now playing a significant role in healthcare. In August 2022, the BBC reported that a group of international surgeons had been practising in virtual reality for months prior to successfully 75 https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2023/03/metaverse-competition-regulation-and-other- stories-you-need-to-read-this-week/ 124 separating two conjoined-headed twin children who were three years old.76 After sharing important veins in their brains at birth , the two identical twins had to undergo seven surgeries. Surgeons from all around the world collaborated in virtual environments to plan and carry out the ground - breaking treatment with the aid of VR applications. 4.29 The global market for metaverse in healt hcare is projected to grow at a CAGR of 35.28% and is expected to reach a valuation of $54.47 billion by 203077 (See Figure 4.x). Figure 4.3 : Global Metaverse Healthcare Market Revenue Source : appiventiv.com The Metaverse technologies are being used in several diagnostic and therapeutic applications, as well as in medical training. Some example use cases are discussed in following sections. 4.30 Training, education, and skill building - The metaverse’s immersive capabilities like 3D visuals, 360 video s, haptics etc. allow cost-effective, fascinating, engaging and personalized learning experience. It enables medical staff onboarding, training, and upskilling with higher efficiencies on a larger scale at anytime and anywhere. Medical training is otherwise expensive and dependent on availability and cost of cadavers, equipment, and medical professionals. No risk simulations and gamifications are 76 https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/voices/future-of-metaverse-in-the-healthcare- sector/ 77https://www.statista.com/outlook/amo/metaverse/metaverse-health-and-fitness/worldwide 5.64 6.57 8.27 11.31 16.57 24.86 35.75 46.60 54.47 0.00 10.00 20.00 30.00 40.00 50.00 60.00 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 Revenue (In Billion USD) 125 powerful utilities that engage the user’s sense of sight, hearing, and touch to create real -life experiences. It allows to train healthcare professionals on types of equipment and therapeutics . Metaverse also enables healthcare professionals to simulate the impact of a suggested treatment on the patient’s body before it is applied. Pharma companies can simulate the experiences caused by various conditions and study their drug’s performance. Some leading medical universities train surgeons in a virtual operating room with a table, instruments, and a virtual patient. 4.31 Patients with phobias like acrophobia are current ly being treated by doctors by putting them in virtual environments to confront their concerns. VR is already used by psychologists and psychiatrists in aversion therapy, where patients can interact with situations that cause them anxiety, in safe environm ents where every aspect of the interaction can be closely monitored and controlled. Today, medical images—during radiology diagnosis —are visualized slice by slice on 2D screens. The metaverse technology enables advanced visualization of medical imaging and the patient’s anatomy, improves error rates, speed, and outcomes .

The metaverse technology enables advanced visualization of medical imaging and the patient’s anatomy, improves error rates, speed, and outcomes . Metaverse technologies has the potential to enhance the value for disease analysis and surgical planning. The immersive and visualization capability of the metaverse can deliver more intera ctive and realistic medical experiences. Many healthcare providers are using AR to assist in medical procedures, including surgical preparation and execution in spine surgeries and catheter placement. 4.32 In India also the impact of the metaverse on clinical c are is enormous . Surgeons are already using immersive technologies and robotics to perform minimally invasive surgeries. By getting a 3D image of a patient’s body, surgeons can plan their surgical protocols ahead of time and using AR can get ideas on what obstacles lie ahead during the intervention. Now, India is set to get its first clinic in the metaverse. In August 2022, Hyderabad-based Yashoda Hospitals Group has acquired space on Decentraland (a metaverse platform where users can buy and sell property 126 and engage in shared digital experience) in order to set up a virtual clinic.78 In February 2022, The Apollo Group of Hospitals announced a tie-up with California-based 8chili Hint VR platform. 8chili Hint VR is an end-to-end platform to manage metaverse strategy helping in original 3D content creation, metaverse customisation and delivery of this content across various metaverse real estate. The focus of VR in patient care would be for pre-post operative counselling, increasing patient outcomes by bringing in relaxing narratives that induce control over one’s psychological responses. The VR will also help in a personalised approach to every patient. 4.33 Machenn Innovations , a virtual reality -based train ing startup in India , offers a cloud -based platform that provides access to more than 1000 medical equipment virtual training programs. The virtual training platform helps medical equipment professionals, engineers, and healthcare professionals access training related services. There are about 5.2 million medical errors registered annually that result in 83,000 deaths and 1.7 million injuries associated with inappropriate medical device usage.79 These errors are committed by low skilled employees who are less trained in handling sophisticated medical equipment aided with advanced digital technology. There is also a dearth of skilled trainers and the medical equipment industry is also manpower- and financially-intensive. There is also a fear of equipment dama ge during classroom -based hands -on training programs. VR-based training overcomes all these limitations. B. Metaverse in Manufacturing 4.34 Metaverse has the potential to be used in variety of ways in manufacturing. There are several potential Metaverse use -cases in manufacturing such as virtual prototyping, virtual training, virtual 78https://www.firstpost.com/india/explained-into-the-metaverse-hyderabads-yashoda- hospitals-becomes-first-indian-healthcare-group-on-platform-10828881.html 79 https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/daw-metaverse-indias-digital-healthcare-anusha- ashwin 127 assembly and virtual collaboration. One potential application of metaverse in manufacturing is as a platform for collaboration and communication among distributed teams. For example, team members could meet in a virtual factory floor to discuss and work on projects in real -time, regardless of their physical location. 4.35 Digital twin of the factories can be built to simulate and evaluate realtime data from plant operations to suggest changes. This data can then be utilized to create new workflows and streamline a business's processes. Several car manufacturing companies have begun to use the metaverse to improve their industrial processes. Hyundai Motor Company and Unity, a platform for developing real -time 3D content, announced a collaboration plan to design a Meta -Factory for the 2022 Consumer Electronics Show (CES). The concept in volves creating a digital twin of a physical factory, which is supported by a metaverse platform, with the purpose of optimizing operations and resolving issues in a virtual area. 4.36 Several manufacturing companies have begun training staff on how to use and maintain equipment using VR headsets rather than real equipment that can be unsafe or difficult to use in a training scenario. Furthermore, rather than having employees sit in a classroom all day, immersive learning, which blends the sensation and presence of VR with learning theory, data science, and architectural design, enhances the learning experience for employees, particularly younger ones. For example, because training JetBlue mechanics with real",

Furthermore, rather than having employees sit in a classroom all day, immersive learning, which blends the sensation and presence of VR with learning theory, data science, and architectural design, enhances the learning experience for employees, particularly younger ones. For example, because training JetBlue mechanics with real planes is expensive and time consuming, the company implemented a VR solution in collaboration with software developer Strivr. 80 The tool allows technicians to simulate touching a jet in the most realistic way possible, but without the time, money, and risk of the physical environment. 4.37 Field service people and technicians, like new frontline workers, can benefit from AR, VR, and MR technologies for equipment maintenance and 80 https://rejolut.com/blog/metaverse-in-manufacturing-industry/ 128 support. Support teams don’t need to travel all the way and are able to provide remote help usin g VR/AR technologies. Another significant area is in product design for manufacturers. With virtual reality, design engineers from all around the world can cooperate remotely to build a virtual design. Automotive firms develop automobiles by starting with clay models that anybody can create visually . They are then designed in CAD software and using mixed reality - AR and VR - taken in 3D and others are invited to input on the car design. C. Remote virtual office 4.38 Remote working has become a trend in the last few years, and the pandemic has only accelerated this trend. One of the biggest challenges of remote work is staying connected with team and maintaining productivity. In such a scenario, Metaverse can be used for various purposes, including virtual collaboration, team-building exercises, and much more. Nowadays, work meetings are usually held online via Microsoft Teams or Zoom. However, metaverse technology can help create a virtual office space for the team, so that everyone can meet and work t ogether in real -time, regardless of location. It can help to improve communication and collaboration among the team members. 4.39 As metaverse provides the 3D environment, it also could add some fun and excitement to employees' workday. With customisable digital avatars, employees could visit a virtual meeting room, walk up to a virtual help desk, have a chat, or relax with colleagues in a networking lounge. For example, Vice Media Group has teamed up with Bjarke Ingels Group to create \"Viceverse\"81, a digital headquarters in the metaverse. This virtual office allows for meetings, briefings, presentations and demonstrations of metaworld experiments, as well as experimenting with NFTs and Web 3.0. D. Interactive and Immersive learning 4.40 In the education sector, metaverse can be used for interactive and 81https://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/viceverse-opens-its-virtual-doors-inside-the-culture- future/1747945 129 immersive educational experiences. Regarding professional training, metaverse can create an immersive learning environment to help learners absorb information more effectively. In addition, the pace of metaverse- based learning can be adjusted according to learners as they can explore virtual worlds at their own pace and revisit concepts as needed. When it comes to remote learning , metaverse has created new learning opportunities by giving the fundamental subject content in an improved and coordinated manner. The students can interact with variety of objects related to concepts to get a better understanding and enhancement of learning opportunities. As per Statista, the number of users in the metaverse education market is anticipated to reach 14.84 million by 2030.82 4.41 One of the benefits of using VR and metaverse for virtual training is that learners can be exposed to realistic scenarios. For example, in a healthcare simulation, learners can practise treating patients in a safe and controlled environment. Such exposure can help professionals become more comfortable with procedures and protocols before facing them in the real world. 4.42 Another benefit of using virtual space for learning is that learners can receive real-time feedback. This feedback can help learners improve their skills and make the most of their training time. Virtual learning can also help establish effective communicat ion by eliminating the language barrier. It could help people from different countries to study in a single digital space without social or linguistic complications. Here are some real- world examples of Metaverse enabled learning experiences. 4.43 Here are some of the leading examples from academic world on the adaptation of Metaverse and its",

Here are some real- world examples of Metaverse enabled learning experiences. 4.43 Here are some of the leading examples from academic world on the adaptation of Metaverse and its related technologies. The “Virtual Harvard”83 project is a project by Harvard University to create a virtual campus accessible by everyone through Metaverse. Stanford Unive rsity 82 https://www.analyticsinsight.net/how-metaverse-is-impacting-home-schooling-in-india/ 83 https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2021/10/21/virtual-harvard-project/ 130 has conducted “Virtual People” 84 class for over 200 students in the Metaverse. Many universities such as the University of Western Australia, the University of South Florida are using “Second Life” 85 for creating VR content. At the Western Michigan University, Virtual Reality Lab offers the students the opportunity to learn in the virtual world. University College London is involved in providing medical surgical training to its staff and students through immersive VR training sessions. These are some of the examples, however, many universities around the world have piloted various initiatives that use AR/VR and Metaverse to support the learning and teaching activities. 4.44 In India, the National Education Policy (NEP) intends to assimilate Artificial Intelligence into the Indian Education system. From this we can conclude that the Metaverse, with its inclusivity and new approach, can bring exciting changes in this sector for both the teachers and the students. In addition, efforts are also being made by education sector for learning metaverse, because skill development in this innovative technology is a prerequisite for development and deployment of country- specific use cases. In June 2022, IIT-Jodhpur launched a part-time online M.Tech progr amme for working professionals in AR and VR for the semester commencing 2022 -23. And more recently, IT major Tech Mahindra is collaborating with Mahindra University to set up a Makers Lab to promote research and development in quantum computing, XAI (explainable AI) and metaverse. E. Metaverse in Travel and Tourism 4.45 Metaverse is the ne xt defining moment for the Tourism industry . It can provide people, who might not be able to travel physically, a way to explore the world. Some organisations are already providing virtual 3D versions of real-life spaces and locations. For example, it is now possible to explore 84 https://news.stanford.edu/2021/11/05/new-class-among-first-taught-entirely- virtual-reality/ 85 https://secondlife.com/ 131 the Louvre Museum, Paris, in VR. Virtual visitors can view exhibitions, enjoy concerts, or even meet friends for a vi rtual stroll around the museum. However, the benefits of metaverse tourism should not cause panic in the tourism and hospitality sector . Virtual travel experiences in the metaverse would not affect bookings for physical vacations. As a matter of fact, the metaverse would offer a new instrument for the tourism and travel industry to connect with consumers. 4.46 Virtual tourism provide new and better travel inspiration sources to the prospective travellers for an upcoming trip. Travellers who take a VR tour of a location or use VR to try out an experience are more likely to book the real thing. One example would be Thomas Cook’s VR excursions of Manhattan, which offered visitors to their stores a five -minute “taster” of the city. The company saw a 190 per cent inc rease in related bookings.86 Metaverse travel could also make the booking experience more pleasant and engaging , something which an online booking app or website just can’t provide.

Need for an orderly growth of Metaverse 4.48 Some estimates suggest that the metaverse market could be worth up to US$13 trillion by 2030 87. The size of the metaverse will make it hard to ignore and denotes its influence over the way people will live, work and play. Many things that people do today on the internet, may soon be done in the metaverse instead. Regulators and policy makers around the world have started noticing that. The shift to a more virtualized and interactive environment will require regulators to update their existing regulation in a wide range of spheres. 4.49 As application scenarios mature, the Metaverse will develop into an exceptionally large -scale, extremely open, and dynamically optimized system. When any market receives investment in millions of dollars of hard-earned money, legal and regulatory frameworks become a necessity to ensure a degree of ethics, trust, and diligence. To create a system that can support v arious virtual reality application scenarios, creators from different fields will work together. One of the main challenges in regulating the metaverse is the fact that it is decentralized. No single organization owns the metaverse. The infrastructure is not subject to any one country’s rules or regulations. It can’t easily be blocked or manipulated. The technologies, the infrastructure and the data are at nobody’s mercy . The other challenge with decentralization is that it is driven by consumers. Which means Governments need to think carefully about how they will insert themselves into the conversation. Ultimately, people want regulation to protect them, but understanding where that line is now drawn is becoming increasingly challenging. 4.50 Governments could a lso play a more proactive role in helping solve the need for identification and authentication in the metaverse. Greater virtualization requires participants to have greater levels of trust. People 87 https://www.precedenceresearch.com/metaverse-market 133 will want to know they are transacting with legitimate sou rces, that they are receiving services from certified professionals and that they will be recognized as themselves when they need to be. 4.51 Another major challenge that attracts the attention of policy makers and regulators is the safety, privacy and well-being of billions of users at stake. Ensuring trust and transparency in metaverse is essential to instil confidence among the consumers for its adoption. If we do not start a movement of forging trust and safety for the digital spaces where we live, work and play, the next generations may inherit a digital world polluted by predators, hate speech and mistrust. Hence, it is important that regulators across the world get on board sooner and put in place necessary guidance or frameworks fit for metaverse. Then only its benefits will be visible across the economies and societies. 4.52 The characteristics of the metaverse are likely to also create several new questions and challenges that regulators will need to grapple with. How will intellectual property created in the metaverse be protected? How will virtual property sales be taxed? How will antisocial behaviour (such as bullying or indoctrination) be monitored and controlled? How will identities be established, or certifications authenticated? How will healthcare and personal data be handled in virtual settings? Many more such questions and challenges for regulators will arise in time to come. The reality is that the metaverse is big, it’s inevita ble and it is going to require a lot of regulatory guidance. International Experience 4.53 In April 2023, the European Commission launched a public consultation88 to “develop a vision for emerging virtual worlds (e.g. metaverses), based on respect for digital rights and EU laws and values”. The objective of this consultation is to ensure that open, interoperable, and innovative virtual worlds can be used safely and with confidence by 88 Regulating the Metaverse in Europe | Global Policy Watch 134 the public and businesses.

The European Parliament is also working on its own-initiative report on opportunities, risk and policy implications for the metaverse. In response, the European institutions are gearing up to facilitate (and most likely regulate) the development of the metaverse in Europe. This includes the development of digital infrastructure, education of citizens and companies, and highlighting the potential to improve the lives of citizens and the daily operations of industry. 4.54 In September 2022, South Korea’s Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT) announced that it would develop new Metaverse regulations to encourage widespread adoption of the Metaverse. 89 This means that MSIT , South Korea is not going to regulate this new service with existing law. Over the last few years, South Korea is also making efforts to promote the use of Metaverse in the country . One such initiative is the recent $200 million investment to establish a national Metaverse. MSIT is of the opinion that that applying old laws to a new industry like the Metaverse will stifle its long-term growth and innovation. 4.55 In July 2022, Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) has established an office named the “Web 3.0 Policy Office” under the Minister’s Secretariat. The office has the mandate of strengthening the framework for developing the business environment in relation to Web 3.0. It will serve as a Cross -Departmental Internal Organization, bringing together departments responsible for industrial finance, taxation, and corporate system , media and content, sports, fashion, and the other related industries. Web 3.0 is a term used to describe the third iteration of the internet that is powered by blockchain -related technologies like non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and digital assets for creating value and managing data. Japan has realised that d ue to the younger generation’s interest in Web 3.0, the digital assets and spaces become more important 89 South Korea's MSIT Reveals Plans To Enact Special Metaverse Laws - Forbes India 135 to its economy. 4.56 The US Congress is more likely to take a ‘wait and watch’ approach to metaverse regulation. The CHIPS and Science Act was passed in 2022, which will see billions of dollars in emerging technologies research funding. The initial focus of US Congress will be ensuring US companies’ competitiveness in the field and exploring the enabling technologies of the metaverse, such as blockchain, VR and AR.90 4.57 In China, a metaverse industry group, the Metaverse Industry Committee, was formed under the state -supervised China Mobile Communications Association, in December 2021. The committee has the stated objecti ves of strengthening innovation and integration among metaverse builders, organizing the training of professionals, and promoting new thinking. In addition, cryptocurrencies have been banned in China since September 2021, with concerns over their potential impact on China’s financial markets and currency stability. 4.58 In May 2022, the World Economic Forum (WEF) launched the “Defining and Building the Metaverse” initiative.91 The goal of the initiative is to build consensus among major metaverse stakeholders and contribute to a future metaverse that is economically viable, interoperable, safe, equitable and inclusive. This initiative has brought together a global, multisector working group of more than 100 experts in academia, civil society, government, technology and business. All insights, frameworks and guidance published in the frame of this initiative are being co -designed and guided by this working group via two tracks: governance and economic and social value creation . The value creation tra ck looks at the opportunities in consumer, industrial and enterprise metaverses.

XR Association93 is another such multistakeholder initiative leading the way for the responsible development and adoption of XR. The XR Association represents the broad ecosystem of the XR industry including headset manufacturers, technology platforms, component and peripheral companies, i nternet infrastructure companies, enterprise solution providers, and corporate end-users. Initiatives taken in India 4.60 Since 2015, India has risen almost 4 1 places in the Global Innovation Index94, now ranking 40th in the world and first among the lower middle income group countries . India also has a thriving culture of entrepreneurship, which has recently experienced significant growth. In 2021, a record 44 unicorns were created in India with a total valuation of $ 93.00 Bn.95 The use of digital payment mechanisms has grown rapidly. Furthermore, consumption of video streaming and gaming in India has also been increasing at a scorching rate. India is the world’s largest mobile gaming market in terms of App downloads. The sector is expected to grow by 20% by FY25 to reach INR 231 Bn.96 4.61 These developments in the country have been taking place within the broader context of the Government of India trying to foster a digital 92 https://metaverse-standards.org/ 93 https://xra.org/ 94 Source: Global Innovation Index Database, WIPO, 2022. 95 https://www.investindia.gov.in/indian-unicorn-landscape 96 https://www.investindia.gov.in/sector/media/gaming 137 economy worth up to $1 trillion by 2025.97 It has developed incentives and policies for technologies and industries that could be viewed as forming the building blocks of the metaverse. Its National Blockchain Strategy was released in December 2021.98 Reserve Bank of India has launched pilots of Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) in both Wholesale (for interbank transactions) and Retail (for the public) segments. In December 2022, Government of India has launched the new draft policy for the Animation, Visual Effects, Gaming, and Comics and Extended Reality (AVGC-XR) sector, at the national and state level with an objective to boost India’s domestic capacity and develop opportunities in the industry. VII. Policy Challenges and issues for consultation A. Creating Awareness 4.62 The metaverse is not a distant or hypothetical concept. India has a unique opportunity to shape and benefit from this emerging phenomenon. However, this requires creating awareness about the metaverse among its diverse and dynamic population. By doing so, India can not only join but also lead the gl obal movement towards a more connected, creative, and collaborative future. Therefore, it is important to create awareness about the metaverse among the citizens of India. Creating awareness about the metaverse can help India leverage its strengths in information technology, innovation, and creativity to become a leader in the development and adoption of the metaverse. It can enable India to address some of its pressing issues, such as access to quality education, health care, and employment opportunities, by using the metaverse as a platform for delivering inclusive and affordable solutions. It can foster a culture of digital citizenship and literacy among Indians, who can learn to use the metaverse responsibly and respectfully, while also protecting their rights 97 https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID=1565669 98 NATIONAL STRATEGY ON BLOCKCHAIN (psa.gov.in) 138 and interests. In view of this, the opinion of stakeholders is solicited on: Q.16. What are the policy measures required to create awareness and promote use of Metaverse, so that the citizens including those residing in rural and remote areas may benefit from the Metaverse use cases and services to create new economic activities and increase employment opportunities and thereby promote economic growth of the country? B. Privacy, Safety and Security 4.63 Over the last two decades, technology companies have made a science of tracking and characterizing users on their platforms, as it enables the targeted advertising. Such targeting has been a boon for advertisers and a windfall for media platforms, resulting in some of the most valuable corporations in histor y.

B. Privacy, Safety and Security 4.63 Over the last two decades, technology companies have made a science of tracking and characterizing users on their platforms, as it enables the targeted advertising. Such targeting has been a boon for advertisers and a windfall for media platforms, resulting in some of the most valuable corporations in histor y. Unfortunately, such targeting has exploited consumers, reduced personal privacy, and has made social media a polarizing force by allowing third -parties to deploy customize messaging that is skilfully aimed at very specific demographic groups. This tactic has had the widespread effect of amplifying existing biases and preconceptions in populations, radicalizing political views and spreading misinformation. 4.64 In the metaverse, these problems are likely to get significantly worse. Because the technology will not just track where users click, but where they go, who they are with, what they do, what they look at, even how long their gaze lingers. Immersive platforms will also track facial expressions, vocal inflections, and vital signs, while intelligent algorit hms use such data to predict each person’s real-time emotional state . Tracking will also include real -time monitoring of user gait and posture, assessing when users slow down to browse products or services. Metaverse platforms will even monitor manual reach, assessing when users grab for objects (both real and virtual) and tracking how long they hold the objects to investigate. This will be especially invasive in the augmented metaverse in which user gaze, gait, and reach will be monitored in the real world, for example while 139 shopping in augmented physical stores. 4.65 Hence, metaverse raises critical issues like privacy, safety and security which require greater deliberation. All the challenges that we currently have in online applications, such as snooping, data breaches, harassment, and hate speech are likely to be amplified in coming times with increased digitisation and online activities. As in the case of any other technology, data lies at the centre of the development of the metaverse. The rise in virtual interactions and the unique features of the metaverse means greater sharing of data . This may lead to a surge in threats of data breaches and concerns around how technology companies collect and process the personal data of people. These concerns are all t he more prominent for countries like India that still do not have a dedicated data protection legislation. 4.66 In addition to data theft concerns, the increase in virtual interactions and the growth of concepts like digital avatars will make the tracking of cybercriminals and interception of illegal content more pernicious. The questions of legislations and jurisdictions that will be applicable in this boundless digital world is also a prominent concern requiring consideration by lawmakers. In view of this, the issue on which the stakeholders need to deliberate is: Q.17. Whether there is a need to develop a regulatory framework for the responsible development and use of Metaverse? If yes, kindly suggest how this framework will address the following issues: i. How can users control their personal information and identity in the metaverse? ii. How can users protect themselves from cyberattacks, harassment and manipulation in the metaverse? iii. How can users trust the content and services they access in the metaverse? iv. How can data privacy and security be ensured in the metaverse, 140 especially when users may have multiple digital identities and avatars across different platforms and jurisdictions? C. Experimental Campuses 4.67 While the technical, demographic and policy foundations for the metaverse appear to be present in India, there remains the operational challenge of building the metaverse. For an orderly growth of an innovative technology like Metaverse, there is a need to provide a conducive environment for testing and validating new technologies and applications that can enable the creation and integration of virtual worlds with the physical world. Such technologies may include immersive interfaces, spatial computing, blockchain, artificial intelligence, and 5G/6G networks. 4.68 It is also required to foster cross -disciplinary and cross -sectoral collaboration among various stakeholders who can contribute to the development and adoption of the Metaverse. These stakeholders may include academia, industry, government, civil society, and end-users. By working together, they can share knowledge, resources, and feedback, as well as identify and address the opportunities and challenges of the Metaverse. In order to attract more investment and",

In order to attract more investment and support for its further development and expansion, the outcomes and impacts of the Metaverse projects need to be showcased and disseminated to the wider public and potential partners . Experimental campuses in India can foster the development of metaverse use cases. In view of this the question arises is: Q.18. Whether there is a need to establish experimental campuses where startups, innovators, and researchers can collaborate and develop or demonstrate technological capabilities, innovative use cases, and operational models for Metaverse? How can the present Co Es be strengthened for this purpose? Justify your response with rationale and suitable best practices, if any. D. Interoperability 4.69 Building the metaverse environment requires interconnection and 141 interoperability among many devices and platforms across the digital ecosystem. Major tech companies are rapidly shap ing the metaverse environment building blocks and will likely take a lead in defining technical standards and protocols , which may be their proprietary solutions. This will provide these companies with unparalleled opportunities to monopolise digital markets. To prevent such undue advantage to these selected market players, efforts are required for the development of open Metaverse standards. Such protocols and standards may be essential for fostering innovation, collaboration and inclusion in the metaverse ecosystem. Open interoperability protocols and standards will enable different metaverse platforms and applications to communicate and interact with each other seamlessly . It will also help in building an affordable device ecosystem for the users. 4.70 The metaverse consists of many spaces, and new spaces might be included over time. Users might expect that their avatar and properties bought in one digital space, can be used in another digital space. For example, a buyer can bring its digital wallet into a virtual world hosted by another provider.This requires standardiza tion and interoperability among the spaces making up the metaverse. With open interoperability standards in place, the users may b ring and use assets from one space into other spaces By choosing either a trusted third -party intermediary or self - management with decentralized data stores, a user can create a single interoperable token that provides authentication into multiple different independent services, devices, platforms and systems. It will allow users and stakeholders to benefit from frictionless development and experience. 4.71 The ITU-T Focus Group on metaverse (FG-MV)99 was established in December 2022 to lay the groundwork for technical standards to help everyone benefit from metaverse services. At present, FG -MV comprises 99 https://www.itu.int/hub/2023/04/metaverse-focus-group-calls-for-contributions/ 142 eight working groups as mentioned in the following table: Table 4.1 : ITU Metaverse Focus Group – Working Groups FG-MV Working Groups Mandate of the Working Group 1 General Build clarity around key metaverse concepts, service models, and enabling technologies for metaverse platforms and services. 2 Applications and Services Document envisaged use cases of metaverse applications and their technical requirements. 3 Architecture and Infrastructure Network architectures and networking and computing infrastructure. 4 Virtual/Real world Integration structured data models and application and service integration between virtual and real worlds 5 Interoperability technical requirements for interoperability across metaverse platforms, applications, and services. 6 Security, Data & PII [personally identifiable information] Protection necessary building blocks with respect to data and digital asset ownership and their security dimensions. 7 Economic, Regulatory & Competition aspects Analyse metaverse value chains and identify questions for the consideration of regulatory authorities. 8 Sustainability, Accessibility & Inclusion explore social and environmental dimensions of metaverse sustainability, promoting diversity and inc lusion and specific consideration of the needs of persons with disabilities. In view of the above , the opinion of stakeholders are solicited on the following issue: Q.19. How can India play a leading role in metaverse standardization work being done by ITU? What mechanism should be evolved in India for making an effective and significant contribution in Metaverse standardisation?

Kindly provide elaborate justifications in support of your response. 143 E. Governance & Oversight 4.72 The metaverse is still in the research phase, and regulatory policies need to be developed for the society to benefit from the opportunities offered by the metaverse. It is essential to secure networks, build confidence in the metaverse through open standards and interoperability, and focus on personal privacy, security, data protection, and child rights. As the metaverse grows and evolves, it will pose new challenges for various stakeholders, such as users, developers, platforms, regulators, and society at large. Therefore, there is a need for collaborative approach for regulation of the metaverse to ensure its positive impact and value creation for society. 4.73 Governance is needed for operating the metaverse to ensure consistency, transparency, accountability, and safety. As discussed earlier, metaverse encounters governance challenges due to its decentralized nature. Mirror governance is a concept that refers to the alignment of the interests and incentives of d ifferent stakeholders in a decentralized system. It is a concept that explains how a decentralized organization can align its governance structure with the governance structure of the blockchain platform that supports it. By doing so, the organization can achieve more consistency, transparency, and accountability in its decision -making processes, as well as benefit from the security and scalability features of the blockchain technology. Mirror Governance can be implemented using smart contracts, DAOs (decentralized autonomous organizations) etc., to create self -governing entities that operate according to predefined governance rules and logic, without human intervention or intermediaries. 4.74 To take advantage of the benefits of the metaverse, there is a need to create a governance environment that fosters interoperability and security. Global regulatory discussions should take place to ensure that the metaverse is accessible to all and that its governance has community input. Efforts should also be made to bridge the digital divide and create opportunities for education using the metaverse. As the metaverse has the 144 potential to generate significant economic value, Governments and industry must work together to train the skilled workforce necessary to create and develop the metaverse. Additionally, governments and stakeholders must balance needs of public and private sector stakeholders to ensure that the metaverse benefits all. Hence, the opinion of stakeholders is solicited on the following issue: Q.20. (i) What should be the appropriate governance mechanism for the metaverse for balancing innovation, competition, diversity, and public interest? Kindly give your response with reasons along with global best practices. (ii) Whether there is a need of a nation al level mechanism to coordinate development of Metaverse standards and guidelines? Kindly give your response with reasons along with global best practices. F. Content Moderation 4.75 The immersive and interactive nature of the metaverse has the potential to trans form user experiences and to allow brands to build more meaningful relationships with consumers . In doing so, m etaverse is enabling children and adults from every corner of the planet to learn and experience things that was unavailable to them till now. Web2 era has taught us that anonymity and online culture can bring out the worst in some people. The online disinhibition effect will be more profound in the immersive and virtual world with an increasing potential for invasive and damaging abuse. 4.76 The metaverse’s safety problem is complex and opaque.

The onus should not be on the children to have to report that by the time any potential trauma or damage is done. 4.77 The metaverse is a new and emerging digital space that offers unprecedented opportunities for creativity, collaboration and social interaction. However, it also poses significant challenges for content moderation, as it involves diverse platforms , technologies and communities with different norms and expectations. There is a need to identify best practices, common standards and ethical principles for ensuring a safe and respectful environment for all users. To address these challenges, consultation with stakeholders is solicited on the following: Q.21. Whether there is a need to establish a regulatory framework for content moderation in the metaverse, given the diversity of cultural norms and values, as well as th e potential for harmful or illegal content such as hate speech, misinformation, cyberbullying, and child exploitation? Q.22. If answer to Q.21 is yes, please elaborate on the following: i. What are the current policies and practices for content moderation on Metaverse platforms? ii. What are the main challenges and gaps in content moderation in the Metaverse? iii. What are the best practices and examples of effective content moderation in the Metaverse or other similar spaces? 146 iv. What are the key principles and values that should guide content moderation in the Metaverse? v. How can stakeholders collaborate and coordinate on content moderation in the Metaverse? G. Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) 4.78 The protection of intellectual property and ownership is a very important legal issue that is likely to emerge in Metaverse. One of the main issues is the lack of clear ownership and attribution of digital assets and creations in the metaverse. If creations are built by Artificial Intelligence, then it is difficult to accord it IPR protection since currently only a work emerging from a human being is considered copyrightable. Protecting the IPR of content creators will also be a challenge considerin g the difficulty in tracking copyright infringements in the virtual space. 4.79 Another issue is the jurisdictional complexity and uncertainty of the metaverse. The metaverse is not bound by physical borders or national laws, but rather by the rules and policies of different platforms and service providers. This creates a potential for conflicts and inconsistencies among different legal systems and regimes. These IPR issues need to be addressed and resolved in order to foster innovation, creativity, and trust in the metaverse. The stakeholders involved in the development and governance of the metaverse should collaborate and cooperate to establish clear and fair rules and standards for IPR protection and enforcement in the metaverse. The users should also be awar e of their rights and responsibilities as creators and consumers of digital content in the metaverse. 4.80 The existing legal framework may not be adequate to address the IPR issues in the metaverse, such as infringement, ownership, licensing, and enforcement. Therefore, some modifications are required in the legal framework to address these issues. In view of this, the inputs of 147 stakeholders are invited on the following issue related to IPR: Q.23. Please suggest the modifications required in the existing legal framework with regard to: i. Establishing mechanisms for identifying and registering IPRs in the metaverse. ii. Creating a harmonized and balanced approach for protecting and enforcing IPRs in the metaverse, taking into account the interests of both creators and users of virtual goods and services. iii. Ensuring interoperability and compatibility of IPRs across different virtual environments.

Introduction 5.1 5G is set to become a connectivity fabric that connects people, devices, machines and ecosystems . Promising use-cases like smart farming , remote healthcare, industry 4.0, immersive and interactive learning using AR/VR, etc. could go a long way in enabling the success of India. With emerging technologies like massive IoT, AR/ VR, AI, robotics, etc. 5G in India will be an enabler for this digital transformation. With increasing digitization enabled by 5G, the volume of data will increase exponentially, providing opportunities for better governance and service delivery. India’s ambitions of becoming a $5 trillion-dollar digital economy depends on its ability to harness the value of data . The process of extracting economic value out of data and information is referred to as Data Monetization. 5.2 Data monetization has become a critical aspect of the digital transformation journey for organisations. With the emergence of the data economy, the volume, velocity, and variety of data available are overwhelming. IDC has estimated that 95% of organizations will consume some form of outside data KPIs digitally by 2023. However, gaining access to the right data is challenging. In a recent study conducted across 34 countries, it was found that only 1 in 12 firms is fully monetizing their data.101 This can be attributed to the fact that most organisations do not have the infrastructure to collect and store data, let alone use it to generate insights. Additionally, many organisations do not have the resources or expertise to analyze the data they collect and turn it into 101 From insights to revenue: Growing importance of data monetizationDATAQUEST (dqindia.com) 149 actionable business decisions. With the exponential growth of data, the potential for data monetization is immense. 5.3 Companies with a strong data -driven culture focus on internal data monetization, us e data to improve business processes, s treamline decision-making, cut operational costs, elevate User Experience, generate new revenue streams, and boost employee productivity. Data -driven companies such as Amazon, Meta, and Apple focus on data -driven business models to develop new products and services, improve customer experience, and generate additional revenue streams. The global data monetization market is expected to grow from $2. 63 billion in 202 1 to $12.22 billion in 2030, a CAGR of 19.6%.102 This will be driven by the increasing magnitude of generated data, awareness of data monetization, and emerging tech opportunities such as Business Intelligence and Analytics (BI&A), cloud computing, blockchain, IoT, social networks, and post-Covid-19 pandemic business approaches and strategies. Figure 5.1 : Global Data Monetization Market Size Source : Polaris Market Research 5.4 The Indian data monetization market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 7.02% over the forecast period of 2019-2024.103 Rapid growth of industries on account of increasing support from the government, presence of a good number of MSMEs and large enterprises and increasing digitization of 102 https://www.polarismarketresearch.com/industry-analysis/data-monetization-market 103 https://www.researchandmarkets.com/reports/4767070/india-data-monetization- market-forecasts-from 150 business processes is increasing the volume of data generated every day. Some of the key drivers for this growth are: i. The increasing adoption of data analytics and business intelligence tools across various sectors, such as banking, ins urance, telecom, retail, healthcare, and manufacturing. ii. The growing availability and accessibility of data from various sources, such as social media, IoT applications, public domain, and government initiatives like Aadhaar and Digital India. iii. The rising de mand for personalized services, which require insights into customer behavior, preferences, and needs. 5.5 However, organisations face multiple challenges while doing data monetization. There is a lack of a clear data strategy and governance framework that defines the objectives, roles, responsibilities, policies, and standards for data collection, storage, processing, sharing, and usage. Another major challenge is t he scarcity of skilled talent and expertise in data science, analytics, and engineering that can extract value from data and generate actionable insights. Organisations are also facing difficulties due to the complexity and diversity of data sources and formats that require integration, harmonization, and quality assurance. The et hical and legal issues related to data privacy, security, ownership, etc. is also a significant challenge. II.

The et hical and legal issues related to data privacy, security, ownership, etc. is also a significant challenge. II. International Experience 5.6 Open Government Data (OGD) platforms have recently become the channel of choice for Governments to provide transparency and accountability. OGD is based on a simple idea that Government data be a shared resource. The purpose is to enable citizens, the rese arch community and the private sector to reuse public data for knowledge creation and innovation. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) defines OGD as “a philosophy- and increasingly a set 151 of policies - that promotes transparency, accountability and value creation by making government data available to all”. 5.7 The Public Sector Information (PSI) Directive in Europe of 2003 and the open data initiative in the United States (US) in 2008 were the first steps in the direction of making government data publicly accessible. OGD as a term arose in international debates in the early 2010s. In 2013, the G8 open data charter (ODC) set five international principles : “Open by Default”, “Timely and Comprehensive”, “Accessible and Usable”, “Comparable and Interoperable”, “For Improved Governance and Citizen Engagement”, “For Inclusive Development and Innovation”. The Open Government Partnership ( OGP)104 was also set up by OECD to help countries open their data through these principles. Since then, countries developed their own sets of principles and definitions. Today, open data platforms and initiatives are multiplying; the OGP has 76 country members that commit to biannual plans to improve their open data ecosystems. III. Initiatives taken in India A. Government Initiatives 5.8 India is currently experiencing a digital boom, with widespread access to cheap mobile internet and deeper penetration of internet access. Simultaneously, the Indian government has embraced the use of information technology and has launched numerous e -Governance schemes in the last two decades. These projects create Government-owned personal data based on anonymised interactions with Indian citizens . They also create purely non-personal data like weather, traffic, military, scientific, commercial and economic research data processed by the government in a digital medium. Data processed by the Government thus presents enormous economic potential. Data monetization can benefit 104 https://www.opengovpartnership.org 152 various stakeholders, such as data providers, data coll ectors, data processors, data users, and data consumers. However, data monetization also poses significant challenges and risks, such as privacy breaches, data misuse, data quality issues, data security threats, etc. Therefore, a balanced and effective reg ulatory framework is needed to foster data monetization while protecting the rights and interests of all parties involved. In India, several regulatory initiatives have been taken to encourage data monetization while ensuring data protection and governance. Some of these initiatives are discussed here. 5.9 The National Data Sharing and Accessibility Policy (NDSAP)105 published in March 2012, widely regarded as the genesis of open government data in India. NDSAP aims to provide an enabling provision and platform for providing proactive and open access to the data available with various departments / organizations of Government of India. It fac ilitates the access to Government of India owned shareable data and information in both human readable and machine-readable formats. The NDSAP enabled ministries to frame pricing policies for their respective data sets. The implementation guidelines for NDSAP laid out the following principles for sharing data: “Openness, Flexibility, Transparency, Quality, Security and Machine readability.” 5.10 Critically, NDSAP set up India’s Open Government Data platform “data.gov.in”. The platform was formally launched in 2012 and is managed by the National Informatics Centre (NIC) under the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) of the Government of India. Following the launch of data.gov.in, the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA) created “smartCities.data.gov.in”, a portal for use by the 100 cities selected as part of the Smart Cities Mission, which provides city - level data published by the Urban Local Bodies. The India Urban Data Exchange provides a platform to facilitate sharing of data by ci ties to 105 https://dst.gov.in/national-data-sharing-and-accessibility-policy-0 153 collaborate with industry, citizens and academia. Another initiative, “Cityfinance”106 is a portal created by MoHUA and supported by many civil society organisations to provide transparency about municipal finance",

Another initiative, “Cityfinance”106 is a portal created by MoHUA and supported by many civil society organisations to provide transparency about municipal finance in India. Each of these initiatives has seen varying degrees of success in the publication and reuse of data. 5.11 This framework for digitizing government data is not sufficient for the development of an innovative ecosystem of AI, data science and analytics. Therefore, a draft policy, titled India Data Accessibility and Use Policy (IDAUP) was released in February, 2022 for public consultation. It provided for the sale and licensing of public data by the government to the private sector. As per the IDAUP, it was proposed that since certain datasets would be undergoing transformation and value -addition by the government, it would be reasonable for the same to be mon etized; by providing the private sector access to readily available and transformed data sets for their commercial purposes. However, the Draft Data Policy was not well received by the stakeholders, as it allowed the government to monetize public data in the absence of a valid data protection legislation, which could threaten data privacy of individuals in the long run. To harness the full potential of data, a proper framework was required for data governance, which would aid data-based innovation and significantly improve the delivery of government services to its citizens, especially in important areas like education, law and justice, and health; amongst others. The government thus decided to lay out a new draft Policy to address some of the issues in this framework. 5.12 The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) released the draft National Data Governance Framework Policy ( NDGFP) on 26th May 2022, inviting the public to provide feedback and comments on the same. The Policy will be applicable to all such data which is collected and managed by government departments and entities; thus, bringing all 106 https://cityfinance.in/ 154 government departments under its ambit. Even state governments are encouraged to adopt the provisions of this Policy, as may be applicabl e. The Policy will also be applicable to non-personal datasets as it proposes to launch an 'India Datasets Program' which is based on non -personal data. The Policy provides certain rules and methods which would ensure that any anonymized data and non-personal data from both the private or government entities can be accessed by the 'research and innovation eco- system', in a safe and accessible manner. The NDGFP envisages a detailed institutional framework, centered around an “India Data Management Office” (IDMO) that shall be set up under the Digital India Corporation under MEITY. 5.13 While the updated draft policy is an improvement, certain concerns from the older draft versions still exist, especially in terms of effective implementation. Issues of capacity building and incentives that have been a major challenge in earlier efforts to open government data still needs to be addressed. While India has adopted many policies in the past to make government data more accessible (from the RTI Act to the National Data Sharing and Accessibility Policy (NDSAP), challenges in effective implementation are required to be addressed. B. TRAI Recommendations 5.14 In order to take the full advantage of the unprecedented acceleration in digital transformation enabled by 5G ecosystem, it has become necessary to harness the full potential of data . It has also become necessary to promote AI based research and innovation for the growth and development of the country, to facilitate technological advancements by allowing researchers, innovators, private entities and startups to gain access to non-personal datasets . With this objective in mind, the Authority has issued several recommendations to promote data digitisation, monetisation and sharing. 155 5.15 The Authority in its Recommendation s dated 18 th November 2022 on “Regulatory Framework for Promoting Data Economy Through Establishment of Data Centres, Content Delivery Networks, and Interconnect Exchanges in India” has recommended the following: i. For steering the data digitization drive, t he Authority recommends that a statutory body, Data Digitization and Monetization Council (DDMC), be established at the Centre by enactment of new law",

For steering the data digitization drive, t he Authority recommends that a statutory body, Data Digitization and Monetization Council (DDMC), be established at the Centre by enactment of new law or by amendment of the present law. The proposed body should have suitable representation from DoT and Me itY, in addition to representatives from Central and State governments. The proposed body should be entrusted with the responsibility to review and prioritize the avenues which would require more concentrated efforts of data digitization and fix timeframes accordingly. DDMC should also assess the data digitization requirements and define the process framework for use of AI and related technology in data processing, data sharing and data monetization while ensuring the privacy and security of the data owner. The proposed body should also be entrusted with framing policies and incentivization schemes for data digitalization, data sharing, and data monetization. DDMC should be the apex body to oversee all issues related to data digitization, data sharing, and d ata monetization in the country. ii. The Government should put in place a data sharing and consent management framework on lines of Data Empowerment and Protection Architecture (DEPA) framework to provide telecom subscribers consent based option to share their KYC data with recipient TSP when they port their numbers. iii. This framework can later be merged with Financial Stability and Development Council (FSDC) Account Aggregator (AA) system facilitating onboarding of entities from other sectors and in process allowing telecom subscribers to access, control, and consent-based sharing of their other data with any onboarded entity. 156 iv. Formation of Data Digitization and Monetization Council (DDMC), an apex body to oversee all issues related to data digitization, dat a sharing, and data monetization in country. The Authority further recommends that DDMC should also be entrusted with responsibility of putting in place an overarching framework for ethical use of data both by the Government as well as by the corporates in India. The framework should address the generic as well as vertical sector specific requirements. DDMC should also study the possible impact of upcoming technologies on data ethics and come out with relevant rules/guidelines on the subject. 5.16 Subsequently, the Authority in its Recommendations dated 20th July 2023 on “Leveraging Artificial Intelligence and Big Data in Telecommunication Sector.” has reiterated the above recommendations and has further stated that (a) DDMC should now be renamed as “Artificial Intelligence and Data Authority of India” (AIDAI). The Authority recommends that formation of too many statutory authorities/ bodies creates confusion for the sector and therefore, in order to derive synergy, organically the work of AIDAI shoul d be entrusted to TRAI with suitable modifications in the TRAI Act. (b) The functions of the DDMC (now proposed AIDAI) has been reiterated and are summarised below - i. Assess the data digitization requirement in the country; review and prioritize the avenues requiring concentrated efforts for data digitization and fix timeframes accordingly. ii. Be the apex body to oversee all issues related to data digitization, data sharing and data monetization in the country including framing policies and incentivization schemes for data digitalization, data sharing and data monetization. iii. Define the process framework for use of AI and related technology in data processing, data sharing and data monetization while ensuring the privacy and security of the data owner. 157 iv.

DoT’s Reference to TRAI 1.1 Through the letter No. L -14035/10/2022-BWA dated 12.08.2022 (Annexure- 1.1), the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) sent a Reference under the Section 11(1) (a) of the TRAI Act, 1997 (as amended) on the subject - ‘Seeking TRAI recommendations for assignment of E&V Bands; and Microwave Access (MWA) & Microwave Backbone (MWB) spect rum in existing frequency bands of 6/7/13/15/18/21 GHz ’ to Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (hereinafter, also referred to as “TRAI”, or “the Authority”). An extract of the afore mentioned letter dated 12.08.2022 is reproduced below: “TRAI had provided its recommendations dated 29.08.2014 on \"Allocation and Pricing of Microwave Access (MWA) and Microwave Backbone (MWB) RF carriers\". In these recommendations, TRAI had also provided recommendations on allocation and pricing methodology for E band (71 -76/ 81-86 GHz) and V bands (57 -64 GHz) spectrum. Subsequent to DoT's back reference dated 16.10.2015, TRA I's response/ letters dated 17.11.2015, 06.05.2016 and 15.07.2016 were also received by DoT. 2. The matter of E and V band spectrum assignment was deliber ated in DoT, and it emerged that while the spectrum in E and V bands should be assigned through auction for provisioning of commercial telecom services; there may be certain non-TSP/ non-commercial usages like captive/ individual point to point/ multipoint usages, which also need spectrum in these bands and where auction may not be feasible. 2.1 In V band, the device/ chipset eco -system supporting various technologies for data transfer between consumer's devices such as smartphones, camera, laptops etc. has developed. The technologies used for such devices are designed for short -range, indoor, interference -tolerant applications. Therefore, while the V band spectrum can be assigned through auction for establishment of indoor/ outdoor telecom networks, allowin g low 2 power, indoor usages of V band on license-exempt basis for consumer device- to-consumer device data transfer may go a long way in serving greater public interest and realizing significant socio-economic gains. 3. With regard to assignments of MWA & MWB spectrum in frequency bands 6/7/13/15/18/21 GHz to TSPs, it has been decided to seek a fresh recommendation of TRA I on allocation methodology, quantum and pricing of MWA and MWB RF carriers, in view of technological changes which have taken place over the years as well as considering the existing assignments to TSPs. 4. In view of the above, TRAI is requested to provide its recommendations under the terms of clause 11(1) (a) of TRAI Act, 1997 as amended by TRAI Amendment Act 2000 on the following: (a) applicable reserve price, band plan, block size, quantum of spectrum, duration of assignment, scope of services/ usages, spectrum cap, payment terms, eligibility conditions, methodology of auction and other associated conditions for auction of E band spectrum f or establishment of terrestrial and/ or satellite-based telecom networks. (b) applicable reserve price, band plan, block size, quantum of spectrum, duration of assignment, scope of services/usages, spectrum cap, payment terms, eligibility conditions methodolog y of auction and other associated conditions for auction of V band spectrum for establishment of terrestrial and/ or satellite-based telecom networks. (c) quantum of spectrum to be earmarked for non -commercial/ captive/isolated use in E and V bands; and methodology of assignment, where auction is not feasible, and pricing for the same. (d) feasibility, including technical parameters, for allowing low power, indoor, consumer device-to-consumer device usages on license-exempt basis, in parallel to use of the auction acquired spectrum by telecom service providers for establishment of terrestrial and/ or satellite -based",

(d) feasibility, including technical parameters, for allowing low power, indoor, consumer device-to-consumer device usages on license-exempt basis, in parallel to use of the auction acquired spectrum by telecom service providers for establishment of terrestrial and/ or satellite -based telecom networks, in part or full V band. 3 (e) a fresh recommendation on allocation methodology, quantum and pricing of MWA and MWB RF carriers in 6/7/ 13/15 /18/21 GHz bands, for establishment of terrestrial and/ or satellite-based telecom networks as well as for non-commercial/ captive/ isolated use. (f) provide any other recommendations deemed fit for the purpose mentioned under (a) to (e) above in these frequen cy bands, including the regulatory/technical requirements as enunciated in the relevant provisions of the latest ITU-R Radio Regulations.” 1.2 In this regard, TRAI, through a letter dated 09.09.2022, sought some additional information/ clarifications from DoT . In response, through a letter dated 11.10.2022 and email dated 16.11.2022 , DoT provided the requisite information/ clarifications to TRAI. Some of the key information/ clarifications sought by TRAI and the response received from DoT are mentioned below: (a) Considering that DoT in its reference letter dated 12.08.2022 had mentioned, inter-alia, that “it has been decided to seek a fresh recommendation of TRAI on allocation methodology, quantum and pricing of MWA and MWB RF carriers, in view of the technological changes which have taken place over the years as well as considering the existing assignments to TSPs ”, TRAI requested DoT to provide a detailed note elabo rating the rationale (technological changes referred by DoT and its relationship with the existing assignments) for seeking fresh recommendations from TRAI. In this regard, DoT provided the following inputs: “It may be mentioned that since the recommendati ons on MWA/ MWB dated 29 -08-2014, two WRCs had held in between and WRC -19 has adopted many bands for IMT e.g. 26 GHz, 28 GHz, 38 GHz & 42 GHz, which were part of 2014 recommendations for backhaul purposes. Among others, the band 26/ 28 GHz, 38 GHz, 47 GHz, 66 GHz to 71 GHz have been identified/ adopted for IMT. Further, 3GPP has identified 52.6 GHz to 71 GHz for 5G NR (New Radio). The 3GPP have also adopted use 4 of spectrum bands as IAB (Integrated Access Backhaul). Also, Study has begun at ITU under agenda item 9.1(c) for use of Fixed service spectrum band (that includes Backhaul bands also) for use in IMT System for providing fixed broadband services. Considering these developments, TRAI's recommendations of 2014 and 2015 in the matter are required to be revisited by TRAI.” (b) Considering that DoT in its letter dated 12.08.2022, ha d stated, inter- alia, that “[t]he matter of E and V band spectrum assignment was deliberated in DoT, and it emerged that while the spectrum in E and V bands should be assigned through auction for provisioning of commercial telecom services ”, TRAI requested DoT to provide, inter-alia, the following information/ clarifications: i. A detailed note elaborating the rationale for arriving at the conclusion that the spectrum in E & V bands should be assigned through auction for provisioning of commercial telecom services. ii. Global practices where E & V bands have been assigned through auction, which were considered by DoT. iii. Status of TRAI's recommendations of 2014 on pricing for link -to- link assignment of E & V bands. In response, DoT provided the following inputs: “TRAI may recall its letter dated 08.07.2015, wherein, it was stated that \"It is for DoT to take a policy decision as to whether it is legally tenable to allocate spectrum by any other mechanism (viz, administrative) than auction in consultation with the Ministry of Law.\" Subsequently, opinion of Ministry of Law & Justice (MoLJ) as well as opinion of Ld. AG was sought. The Ld. AG, among others, opined at para 7 that in cases where there are competitors who are prepared to bid for the limited spectrum which is available, be considered throug h auction so that the Government would be able to earn revenue from such competitive bidding, among others. In this regard, many TSPs / ISPs have demanded 5",

In response, DoT provided the following inputs: “TRAI may recall its letter dated 08.07.2015, wherein, it was stated that \"It is for DoT to take a policy decision as to whether it is legally tenable to allocate spectrum by any other mechanism (viz, administrative) than auction in consultation with the Ministry of Law.\" Subsequently, opinion of Ministry of Law & Justice (MoLJ) as well as opinion of Ld.

In this regard, many TSPs / ISPs have demanded 5 for auction of E & V band from time to time. This view of TSPs has also been endorsed by the TRAI in its recent recommendations dated 11.04.2022 at para 2.405 to 2.411 and noted finally at para 2.411 that DoT may appropriately examine the issue raised by stakeholders. Regarding V band spectrum, some countries had delicensed it during 2010 to 2014, when th ere was no visibility on the use of this spectrum for 5G/ IMT and also the alternate telecommunications technologies like Wi-Fi have evolved to make it an equivalent technology to 4G/ 5G. Further, during last 7 -8 years, technologies have developed which compete with 4G/ 5G/ IMT. Therefore, hardly any country has delicensed V-band post TRAI's recommendations in 2014 -2015 as 5G & equivalent technologies have been developed in these bands. Further, these bands may also play key role in 6G technology. The recent 3GPP Release -17 dated 12th December 2020 envisage use of 52.6-71 GHz (which include V -band- 57-64 GHz under consideration in India) for 5G terrestrial networks. It also uses this band for Integrated Access and Backbone (IAB). Further, regarding the recommendations for assignments of these bands on link-to-link basis, DoT is of the view that the large reusability /small link size, dense deployment, makes E & V bands more suitable for LSA wise assignments rather than link-by-link assignment as the accounting/ Administration of large number of links in these bands and charging therein is not feasible in Indian context. In the past due to similar complexity of link-by-link assignment, the link-based charging for MWA/ MWB was discontinued during early 2000 and LS A based assignments/ charging was adopted. As both of E & V band are to be assigned on LSA/ pan India basis, hence, auction of these spectrum bands on LSA basis is feasible and therefore, such spectrum may be assigned through competitive bidding/ auction in accordance with opinion of Ld. AG. 6 The Audit has also recommended, among others, that DoT may take an early decision in consultations with TRAI on allotment/ assignment of spectrum for in E-band (71-76/ 81-86 GHz) and V-band (57-64 GHz) for providing support to mobile communications, ISP service providers and effective roll out of 5G services through market related process wherever feasible/ viable. Accordingly, after a detailed deliberation, Government has decided to seek recommendations for assignment of E&V bands through auction for provisioning of commercial telecom services band per the reference dated 12.08.2022.” (c) Considering that DoT in its letter dated 12.08.2022, had also sought TRAI's recommendations on “quantum of spectrum to be earmarked for non-commercial/ captive/ isolated use in E & V bands; and methodology of assignment where auction is not feasible and pricing for the same ”, TRAI requested DoT to clarify, inter-alia, as to what type of use (Access/ Backhaul, indoors/ outdoors, etc.) of E & V bands is being envisaged for non-commercial/ captive/ isolated use and details of the demand for spectrum in E & V bands for non -commercial/ captive/ isolated use received by DoT. In response, DoT provided the following inputs: “(a) It is envisaged to use E & V band for non -TSP/ non-commercial usages to the entities for their captive/ individual point-to-point/ multipoint usages/ requirements in isolated manner without any connectivity to public networks in line with isolated/ captive requirements in the part in MW bands. TRAI is requested to assess the demand of such captive usages through consultation process. (b) No such assignments have been made so far. (c) No such demand has been received so far.” 1.3 With respect to the DoT’s view on E & V bands, as conveyed through the letter dated 11.10.2022, and as indicated in Para 1.3 (b) above that ‘[t]his view of TSPs has also been endorsed by the TRAI in its recent recommendations dated 7 11.04.2022 at para 2.405 to 2.411 and noted finally at para 2.411 that DoT",

TRAI’s recommendations of 29.08.2014, inter-alia, included recommendations for opening up of High capacity backhaul E-band (71-76/ 81-86 GHz) and V-band (57-64 GHz), which were still under consideration by DoT. The co mments received from the stakeholders were summarized under para 2.409 and 2.410 of the TRAI recommendations dated 11.04.2022 and in para 2.411, it was mentioned that “the Authority is of the view that DoT may appropriately examine the issue raised by the stakeholders.” Clearly, TRAI did not endorse the views of the stakeholders on the subject. B. The Present Consultation Paper 1.4 In this background, this consultation paper is being issued for soliciting comments of stakeholders on the issues related to the ‘Consultation Paper on Assignment of Spectrum in E -band, V-band, and Microwave Access (MWA) / Microwave Backbone (MWB) Spectrum in Existing Frequency Bands ’. This chapter provides background information on the reference received from the DoT. Chapter II deals with the issues relating to the assignment of spectrum for MWA and MWB. Chapter III deals with the issues relating to the assignment of spectrum in E-band and V -band. Chapter IV deals with valuation and pricing of spectrum in E-band, V -band, MWA and MWB, an d Chapter V summarizes the issues for consultation. 8 CHAPTER II: ISSUES RELATED TO ASSIGNMENT OF SPECTRUM FOR MWA AND MWB A. Background 2.1 ITU in its ‘Vocabulary of terms for wireless access ’1, defined the backhaul communication as ‘ transport of aggregate communication signals from base stations to the core network’. 2.2 A typical mobile network consists of an access network, backhaul and core network. Access network is that part of the network, through which, subscribers access the telecom network services . Access network provides last-mile connectivity, which could be either wired or wireless. Core network is the central element of a mobile network that provides services to subscribers who are connected by the access network. Backhaul network is used to transfer the traffic from/ to the access network to/ from the core network or other nodes of the network. Figure 2.1: Typical mobile network 2.3 For backhauling of telecommunication traffic, wired or wireless media could be used. Traditionally, copper wires were used for backhaul networks . However, with the increas e in traffic, optical fibre cable (OFC) is, at present, the most desired medium as it practically offers infinite capacity. However, laying OFC could be very difficult in some places such as tough terrains, hilly regions, water 1 https://www.itu.int/dms_pubrec/itu-r/rec/f/R-REC-F.1399-1-200105-I!!PDF-E.pdf 9 bodies, etc. Further, in places that are sparsely populated and where telecom traffic is not substantial, laying OFC may not be an economically viable option. Besides, at some places, there may be difficulties in getting permissions for laying OFC, and/ or Right of Way ( RoW) charges for laying OFC could be a matter of concern. As a result, telecom service providers may prefer to deploy wireless backhaul in places, where laying OFC is either diffi cult and/ or economically unviable. 2.4 For wireless backhaul, telecom service providers make use of microwave technology. Microwave is a ‘line -of-sight’ wireless communication technology that uses high frequency beams of radio waves to provide high speed wireless connections that can send and receive voice, video, and data information. 2.5 In mobile communication networks, microwave technology is widely deployed to provide point-to-point (P2P) radio frequency links in mobile backhaul as well as in the backbone network. The m obile backhaul refers to the transport network that connects the core network and the Radio Access",

Microwave is a ‘line -of-sight’ wireless communication technology that uses high frequency beams of radio waves to provide high speed wireless connections that can send and receive voice, video, and data information. 2.5 In mobile communication networks, microwave technology is widely deployed to provide point-to-point (P2P) radio frequency links in mobile backhaul as well as in the backbone network. The m obile backhaul refers to the transport network that connects the core network and the Radio Access Network (RAN) of the mobile communication network. The introduction of small cells has given rise to the concept of ‘front haul’, which is a transport network that connects the macrocell to the small cells. Whilst mobile backhaul and fronthaul are different concepts, the term mobile backhaul is generally used to encompass both concepts2. The backbone network is used to interconnect different nodes situated at different geographical locations. Figure 2.2: Mobile network and the scope of mobile backhaul, Source: GSMA 2 https://www.gsma.com/futurenetworks/wiki/mobile-backhaul-an-overview/ 10 2.6 For the establishment of backhaul P2P links , microwave frequencies in traditional microwave bands (6, 7, 13, 15, 18, and 21 GHz) are used. In these bands, microwave frequencies are generally assigned in blocks of 2x28 MHz, known as microwave carriers. There are two types of microwave carriers viz. Microwave Access (MWA) Carriers and Microwave Backbone (MWB) Carriers. 2.7 MWA carriers are generally in frequency bands of 10 GHz and beyond. These are assigned for short -haul systems which are used to carry traffic through relatively shorter distances. MWA carriers are typically used mainly in the pre- aggregation part of mobile b ackhaul networks. In India, currently , 13 GHz (12.75-13.25 GHz), 15 GHz (14.5-15.5 GHz), 18 GHz (17.7-19.7 GHz,) and 21 GHz (21.2 -23.6 GHz) bands are used for the assignment of frequencies for MWA carriers3. On the other hand, MWB carriers are assigned for relatively longer links. In India, currently , 6 GHz and 7 GHz bands are used for the assignment of frequencies for MWB P2P links. 2.8 Both MWA and MWB are used to connect the network nodes for backhauling the traffic generated by the access network. With the changing requirement due to technological advancements and development of high data applications, higher bands have also been opened up globally to meet the growing traffic backhauling requirement. With the implementation of 5G technology, there may be a requirement for significant increase in wireless backhaul capacity which necessitates for wider bandwidth solutions. 2.9 As per the report by GSMA and ABI Research4 on ‘Wireless Backhaul Evolution- Delivering next-generation connectivity’ of February 2021, while optical fibre will play an important role, microwave backhaul will account for the majority of global backhaul links from 2021 to 2027, with around 65% market share. However, the continued use of wireless backhaul will require an evolution 3 Chapter 2 of the C&AG Report No. 21 of 2018 (https://cag.gov.in/webroot/uploads/download_audit_report/2018/Report_No_21_of_2018_Complianc e_and_Performance_Audit_of_Union_Government_Ministry_of_Communications_.pdf) 4 Wireless Backhaul Evolution-Delivering next-generation connectivity, February 2021 https://www.gsma.com/spectrum/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/wireless-backhaul-spectrum.pdf 11 toward higher frequency bands, which can support wider channels and have a greater total amount of spectrum available. The E -band (70/ 80 GHz) will be important across all regions and is expected to enjoy exceptional growth with an 11.6% CAGR from 2021 to 2027. In more developed marke ts, even higher frequency bands are likely to be important. The W -band (92 GHz to 114 GHz) and D-band (130 GHz to 175 GHz) are expected to start to gain global traction from 2025 onward. The figure given below shows the details of the spectrum bands being used or are being considered in the n ear future for wireless backhaul: Figure 2.3: Spectrum bands being used/ considered for use in near future for wireless backhaul, Source: ITU 2.10 The said report on ‘Wireless Backhaul Evolution-Delivering next -generation connectivity’, further mentions that the traditional microwave bands (6 GHz to 42 GHz) continue to have an important role to play, especially as they can cover longer distances with fewer hops. 2.11 Ericsson in its report o n Microwave Outlook (2022) 5 mentions that there are around 10 million transceivers installed for backhaul around the world and new deployments in the traditional bands (6 GHz to 42 GHz) remain the backbone for wireless backhaul.

Owing to its almost limitless capacity and scalability, it is the right choice for high-capacity routes where logistics are manageable, the capacity need is high, and the potential revenue gain offsets the expense. In the coming years, its share in the mobile backhaul network is likely to go up owing to the expected growth in the data traffic and the increasing requirement of backhaul for new technologies such as LTE, LTE- Advanced, IMT-2020 etc. 2.14 The National Broadband Mission 7 released by DoT in December 2019, envisaged to increase by around two and half times the number of fiberized telecom towers in the country. The National Broadband Mission , 2019 had set the 5-year target as below: 6 GSMA Report on ‘Mobile backhaul options - Spectrum analysis and recommendations’ of September 2018 7 https://dot.gov.in/sites/default/files/National%20Broadband%20Mission%20- %20Booklet_0.pdf?download=1 14 1-year 2-year 3-year 4-year 5-year Fiberization of Telecom Towers (%) Cumulative 35 45 55 65 70 Table 2.2: Target of Fiberization of Telecom Towers8 2.15 As per the press release dated 22.07.2022 9 issued by the Ministry of Communications on the progress on the N ational Broadband Mission, “[a]pproximately 35.11% of Telecom Towers/ BTSs are fiberized as on June 2022. It is envisaged to be increased up to 70% by 2024-25.” However, as can be seen from the above, the year-on-year target of the National Broadband Mission is lagging. B. TRAI’s earlier recommendation s on ‘Allocation and Pricing of Microwave Access (MWA) and Microwave Backbone (MWB) RF carriers’ of 2014 2.16 In 2012, DoT through a reference letter dated 26.11.2012 had sought TRAI’s recommendations on the following: a) Methodology for Allocation and Pricing of MW Access and Backbone (MWA/ MWB) carriers for new service providers and the existing service providers for initial and additional allocations of MW Access and MW backbone carriers. b) Criteria for withdrawal of excess allocation of MWA and MWB carriers from existing service providers. c) Annual spectrum usage charges and criteria for pricing for different bands of MWA and MWB carriers including any upfront charges, along with date of applicability. 8 GSMA Report on ‘Mobile backhaul options - Spectrum analysis and recommendations’ of September 2018 9 https://pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID=1843752 15 2.17 In response, TRAI provided recommendations on ‘ Allocation and Pricing of Microwave Access (MWA) and Microwave Backbone (MWB) RF carriers ’ dated 29.08.2014. A few recommendations relating to MWA/ MWB are reproduced below: “5.1 TSPs should be assigned MWA carriers as per their requirement. However, it will be subject to a ceiling on the number of MWA carriers that can be assigned to a TSP as given in Table 2.5 below.

If any TSP requires carriers in addition to what have been recommended above, it may be examined by the DoT on a case-to-case basis. 2. It has been assumed that each carrier is of size 2x28 MHz. Carrier of 2x56 MHz and 2x112 MHz should be counted as 2 and 4 carries respectively when applying the above ceiling. 3. Access spectrum indicated in this table is a paired spectrum. Therefore, unpaired access spectrum shall be counted as half for the purpose of applying the above ceilings e.g. 20 MHz of unpaired spectrum 16 in the 2300 MHz band shall be considered as equivalent to 10 MHz (paired). 4. The above ceilings may be reviewed periodically. (Para 2.22) 5.2 TSP should be assigned MW carriers as per their request as long as it is within the ceiling limit recommended in Para 2.22(Para 2.29) 5.3 TSPs, holding MWA carriers in excess of the maximum number of carriers recommended by the Authority in Para 2.22, should be asked to surrender the excess MWA carriers in one year’s time period with effect from the dat e the new guidelines come into force. However, in case TSP is left with excess MWA carriers as a result of trading of spectrum, it will have to surrender the excess MW carriers within three months of the effective date of trade. In case TSP wants to retain them, it should be permitted to do so, only if it is able to justify the need of additional carriers to the satisfaction of the DoT. (Para 2.40) 5.4 [I]n future, no TSP should be assigned more than 4 MWA carriers in the 13/15 GHz band. In other bands too , there should be equitable distribution of carriers as far as possible. However, this would not have any impact on existing assignments. This is because of the fact that any re -arrangement of MWA carriers already assigned to TSPs will force them to redesi gn their network which will require them to incur significant costs. (Para 2.43) 5.5 [T]he assignment of MWA carriers should be done on an exclusive basis for the various spectrum bands in 13-42 GH. z range whereas the assignment of MWB carriers should be done on a link-to-link basis. (Para 2.58) 5.6 [T]he assignment of MWA and MWB carriers should continue to be done administratively. (Para 2.62) 5.7 [T]he assignment of MWA and MWB carriers should continue to be done administratively. i. The assignment of MWA carriers should be done for the entire LSA. 17 ii. Assignment of both access spectrum and MWA carriers should be done simultaneously within a period of one month from the date the TSP makes the payment for access spectrum, failing which TSP should be paid compensation at the SBI PLR rate of the amount it had already paid to acquire the access spectrum. iii. In case of delay in the assignment of MWA carriers for a new TSP in a LSA, the effective date of access spectrum assignment may be taken as the date of assignment of the first MWA carrier. (Para 2.69) 5.8 [T]he higher frequency bands viz. 26 GHz, 28 GHz, 32 GHz, 38 GHz and 42 GHz should be earmarked for fixed point -to-point MW carriers and the channeling plan should be kept in line with the ITU -R recommendations. The Authority is also of the view that larger carriers of size 56 MHz (paired) and 112 MHz (paired) should also be assigned to the TSPs in these bands. As the number of assignments made in the 21 GHz band is quite small, the DoT may also examine",

(Para 3.60) 2.18 On some of the issues, DoT sought clarifica tion/ reconsideration on TRAI’s recommendations dated 29.08.2014 through back reference dated 16.10.2015. For the recommendations, as mentioned in para 2.17 above (Recommendations 5.1 to 5.7), DoT in its back-reference mentioned that: 19 (I) In these recommendations, TRAI has proceeded on its promise that MWA and MWB carriers should be allotted on administrative basis, mainly on the following grounds: (i) There is sufficient availability of carriers in MWA bands and other new bands can also be opened. (ii) MWA carriers are important for roll out and adoption of auction mechanism for MWA carriers may act as a barrier for new entrants due to uncertainty about availability of MWA carriers. (iii) Since access spectrum is assigned through auction, there seems to be no justification for another auction for assignment of microwave carriers, as these will be used by the telecom service providers (TSPs) having access spectrum. (iv) Stakeholders have indicated that auction should be preferred me thod when demand is expected to exceed supply and currently carriers are available in abundance. (v) For MWA carriers, link by link allotment requires interference management by WPC Wing, which is very difficult exercise. (II) TRAI has recommended that MWA carriers may be allotted on exclusive basis for the LSA while MWB carriers be allotted on link to link basis, as per the existing practice. (III) With the above background, the TRAI has, inter-alia, recommended ceiling on number of MWA carriers by linking it to the quantum of spectrum held, surrender of excess spectrum held, allotment in future of MWA carriers 13/ 15 GHz bands, exclusive allotment of MWA carriers in 13 -42 GHz bands, link by link allotment of MWB carriers and final finally simultaneous allotment of access spectrum (through auction) and MWA carriers (within one month of payment for access spectrum) failing which, effective date of access spectrum should be shifted and compensation may be paid to the TSP.

(IV) TRAI is requested to reconsider i ts recommendation for MWA / MWB bands, taking into account the facts as detailed in Annexure-A. 20 (IV.1) Microwave Access Spectrum (MWA): The TRAI is requested to re-consider its recommendations for administrative allocation of MWA taking into account the facts mentioned in Annexure -A. In case reconsidered opinion on method of allotment is through auction or any other appropriate methodology ensuring transparency and taking into account the judgement of Hon’ble Supreme Court of India in 2G case, TRAI is requested to recommend reserve price, Spectrum Usage Charge (SUC), quantum of spectrum/ carriers to be allotted to the existing licensees holding MWA spectrum and licensees who do not hold MWA spectrum, migration path for existing administratively allocated MWA spectrum to auction based allocation of MWA spectrum, methodology of auction and associated terms and conditions. (IV.2) Microwave Backbone Spectrum (MWB): It is noted that microwave backbone carriers are allotted on link to link basis in a service area or between service areas and not on exclusive basis i.e. same carrier can be allotted to more than one operator (which is n ot the case for MWA spectrum). The SUC is levied on the basis of percentage of AGR. Further, allotment of MWB carriers through auction may result in exclusivity for successful bidders and this sub -optimal use of MWB carriers as the usability of the frequency spots by other licensees will be blocked. However, in the light of the Supreme Court judgement of 02.02.2012 in 2G case, it is clear that while allotting spectrum, the issues relating to ‘First Come First Served’ (FCFS) as well as auction of spectrum a re to be addressed. TRAI in its recommendations has suggested that Microwave Spectrum should continue to be allotted administratively. Any administrative allotment follows the principle of FCFS which has been denounced by the Supreme Court. Further, there may be instances where a particular spot frequency is claimed by two licencees and the policy should provide for resolution of such situations. 21 Therefore, the TRAI is requested to re-consider its recommendations for allotment of microwave backbone spec trum. TRAI is also requested to recommend methodology of allocation of spectrum/carriers to all categories of telecom licensees, methodology of charging including whether it can be linked to market discovered prices in some other band or not and associated terms and conditions. In addition, the TRAI is also requested to provide its reconsidered recommendations on methodology and pricing for allotment of carriers in these bands to users other than telecom service providers. 2.19 After due consideration, TRAI gave response to the DoT’s back-reference dated 16.10.2015 on 17.11.2015. The relevant extract is given below: “The Authority, after carefully going through the back reference, has noted that the main issue raised by DoT, in all the Microwave bands recommended by the Authority, is regarding allocation methodology of MWA and MWB carriers on administrative basis. Primarily, the DoT has asked the Authority to reconsider its recommendations with regard to assignment of Microwave carriers on administrative basis, stating that as administrative allotment follows the principle of ‘first come first served’ and the same has been denounced by the Supreme Court in its judgement on the 2G case. Regarding allocation methodology of MW carriers, the Authority in chapter-2 of the recommendations in paras 2.18 to 2.29 and paras 2.44 to 2.62, has elaborately explained the rationale for continuing with the existing assignment methodology which was on administrative basis. Regarding query of DoT on legal issue of assignment methodology raised in paras from 5.1 to 5.7 and 5.10 to 5.15 of the back reference, the Authority has already communicated its stand vide its letter No. 102 -6/2014-NSL-II dated 8th July, 2015 (Copy enclosed as Annexure-II).

Examination of issues relating to assignment of MWA and MWB RF carriers in existing frequency bands (6/7/13/ 15/ 18/ 21 GHz) 2.20 DoT through its reference dated 12.08.2022 requested TRAI to provide its recommendations, inter-alia, on allocation methodology, quantum, and pricing of MWA and MWB RF carriers in 6/7/12/15/18/21 GHz bands for establishment of terrestrial and/ or satellite -based telecom networks as well as non - commercial/ captive/ isolated use. (a) Bands and quantum of spectrum 2.21 As per the information provided by DoT, spectrum for MWB is assigned in 6 GHz and 7 GHz bands and spectrum for MWA is assigned in 13 GHz, 15 GHz, 18 GHz, and 21 GHz bands. Details of these bands are given below: Band Frequency range No. of carriers Adjacent channel separation Tx-Rx separation MWB 6 GHz 5925-6425 MHz 8 29.65 MHz 252.04 MHz 7 GHz 7125-7425 MHz 5 28 MHz 161 MHz 7425-7725 MHz 5 28 MHz 154 MHz MWA 13 GHz 12.75-13.25 GHz 8 28 MHz 266 MHz 15 GHz 14.5-15.5 GHz 15 28 MHz 420 MHz 18 GHz 17.7-19.7 GHz 32 27.5 MHz 1010 MHz 21 GHz 21.2-23.6 GHz 40 28 MHz 1232 MHz Table 2.3: Details of MWA and MWB frequency bands 2.22 Spectrum for MWA is assigned to the TSPs with access service authorization on carrier basis i.e., a carrier assigned to a TSP can be used anywhere within the Licensed Service Area (LSA10), while spectrum for MWB is assigned on a point- to-point link basis. Charging for MWA as well as MWB spectrum assignments is done on a percentage of AGR basis. However, the applicable rate as a 10 LSA refers to Telecom Circle/Metro service area as defined for Access Service Authori zation under the Unified License 23 percentage of AGR does not vary with the number of P2P links demanded/ assigned in a carrier to a TSP. For TSPs other than Access Service Authorization, and other entities i.e., non-TSP isolated captive users, MWA/ MWB carriers are assigned on a point -to-point (P2P) link basis. Charging for such spectrum assignments is done on a formula basis. 2.23 Details of the frequency carriers in each MWA and MWB band, as provided by the DoT, are enclosed as Annexure-2.1. 2.24 Since MWB carriers are assigned on P2P basis, multiple links at different locations (latitude -longitude combinations) can be created. Therefore, there may not be any limitation on the number of carriers that can be assigned to a TSP on P2P basis . However, from the present spectrum assignment details provided by DoT, it is observed that assignments have been made in only a few carriers in MWB bands. In 5 out of 8 Carriers in 6 GHz band, there is no spectrum assignment to the Access Service Licensees . In the 7 GHz (7125 - 7425 MHz) band, out of 5 carriers, only one carrier in 12 LSAs has been assigned to the access service providers; thus, this band is largely unutilized. In 7 GHz (7425-7725 MHz) band, it is observed that on average, about 50% of the carriers are unutilized. 2.25 In MWA bands, i.e., 13 GHz, 15 GHz, 18 GHz, and 21 GHz bands, the details of the carriers assigned to the telecom service providers with access service license/ authorization are given below: LSA 13 GHz (Total no. of carriers = 8) 15 GHz (Total no. of carriers = 15) 18 GHz (Total no. of carriers = 32) 21 GHz (Total no. of carriers = 40) Andhra Pradesh 4 13 6 1 Assam 3 11 3 1 Bihar 3 12 2 - Delhi 4 14 9 8 Gujarat 7 12 7 - Haryana 3 11 3 - Himachal Pradesh 6 12 1 - Jammu and Kashmir 3 8 5 1 Karnataka 4 14 6 3 Kerala 3 11 5 3 24 LSA 13 GHz (Total no. of carriers = 8) 15 GHz (Total no. of carriers = 15) 18 GHz (Total no. of carriers = 32) 21 GHz (Total no. of carriers = 40) Kolkata - 15 11",

On average, 50% of carriers in the 13 GHz band have been assigned to the Access Service Providers and 18 GHz and 21 GHz bands are largely unutilized. 2.27 From the information on spectrum assignment provided by DoT, it is observed that the spectrum for MWA and MWB assigned to the Telecom service providers with Access Service License/ Authorization has been shared . However, there could be some assignments to the TSPs other than Access Services licensees and to other entities (non-TSP) for isolated captive use. Therefore, to assess the quantum of spectrum required for different types of users viz. Access service provi ders, TSPs other than access service authorizations, and other entities (non-TSP for non-commercial/ captive/ isolated use), information from the stakeholders needs to be gathered. 2.28 As per the existing framework, MWA carriers are assigned to the TSPs with Access Service authorization exclusively on LSA basis and for TSPs other than access service authorizations, and other entities (non-TSP for non-commercial/ captive/ isolated use), assignments are made on point -to-point link basis. As regards MWB carriers, carriers are assigned on point -to-point link basis to all 25 types of entities. One may contend that MWB carriers should also be assigned exclusively on LSA basis. The contrary argument could be that there are a limited number of carriers in MWB bands and the deployment of MWB carriers may not require exclusive assignment; further, exclusive assignment may result in sub-optimal use of MWB carriers . Exclusive assignment of MWB carriers on LSA basis, may also involve other practical issues. For instance, (a) NLD service provider may want to use MWB link to connect two nodes falling in different LSAs. If spectrum is assigned on an LSA basis, it cannot be guaranteed that the same carrier is assigned in both the LSAs . Assuming that same carrier is assigned in both the LSAs, a provision may have to be created to permit it to utilize spectrum assigned on LSA basis , for across LSA deployment. (b) ISP with ‘C’ Category license/authorization, whose Service Area is Secondary Switching Area (SSA), which is smaller than the concerned LSA, may also like to have MWA/ MWB carrier. 2.29 Therefore, issue arises is whether spectrum for MWA and MWB should be assigned on P2P link basis or for entire LSA for different types of users viz. Access Service Providers, other TSPs, other entities ( non-TSP for non- commercial/ captive/ isolated use). 2.30 Further, s ome of the MW A/MWB bands are overlapping with fixed satellite services (FSS) bands. Details of the bands overlapping with the FSS are: Spectrum Band Frequencies allocated for FSS 6 GHz 5725-6700 Earth to Space 7 GHz 7250-7750 Earth to Space 13 GHz 12.75-13.25 Earth to Space 18 GHz 17.7-19.7 Space to Earth Table 2.5: Details of MWA/ MWB spectrum bands overlapping with FSS 26 2.31 As already mentioned, DoT through its reference dated 12.08.2022 has requested TRAI to provide its recommendations, inter -alia, on allocation methodology, quantum and pricing of MWA and MWB RF carriers in 6/7/12/15/18/21 GHz bands for establishment of terrestrial and/or satellite - based telecom networks as well as non-commercial/captive/isolated use.

In this regard, it is noted that some of these bands have been explicitly referred by DoT for auction of spectrum for space -based communication services to TRAI seeking recommendations. For space-based communication services, TRAI has already issued a consultation paper on ‘Assignment of Spectrum for Space- based Communication Services’ dated 06.04.202311. Further, it may be mentioned that, at present, MWA/ MWB based terrestrial networks coexist with fixed satellite services. For this, ITU has provided an elaborate framework for coexistence of terrestrial services and space-based communication services. 2.32 Further, in response to TRAI’s letter dated 09.09.2022, DoT through its letter dated 11.10.2022 , inter-alia, informed that study has begun at ITU under agenda item 9.1(c) for use of Fixed services spectrum band (that includes Backhaul bands also) for use in IMT System for providing fixed broadband services. It is noted that WRC-23 agenda item No. 9.1(c) is to study the use of International Mobile Telecommunication systems for fixed wireless broadband in the frequency bands allocated to the fixed services on primary basis, in accordance with Resolution 175 (WRC -19). In this regard, the report of the Conference Preparatory Meeting (CPM)12 on technical, operational and regulatory/ procedural matters to be considered by the World Radiocommunication Conference 2023 has noted that: ‘Input contributions were received proposing updates to some of these existing ITU -R Recommendations/Reports.

What quantum of spectrum in different MWA and MW B frequency bands is required to meet the demand of TSPs with Access Service License/ Authorization ? Whether MW A/ MWB spectrum is also required by TSPs having authorizations other than Access Service License/ authorization, and other entities (non -TSP, for non - commercial/ captive/ isolated use)? Information on present demand and likely demand after five years may kindly be provided as per the proforma given below with detailed justification: (i) Present demand Band Quantum of spectrum required (per entity per LSA) TSPs with Access Service License/ Authorization TSPs with other than Access Service License/ Authorization Other entities (non-TSP, for non- commercial/ captive/ isolated use) 6 GHz (5.925-6.425 GHz) 7 GHz (7.125-7.425 GHz) 7 GHz (7.425-7.725 GHz) 13 GHz (12.750-13.250 GHz) 15 GHz (14.5-15.5 GHz) 28 18 GHz (17.7-19.7 GHz) 21 GHz (21.2-23.6 GHz) (ii) Likely demand after five years Band Quantum of spectrum required (per entity per LSA) TSPs with Access Service License/ Authorization TSPs with other than Access Service License/ Authorization Other entities (non-TSP, for non- commercial/ captive/ isolated use) 6 GHz (5.925-6.425 GHz) 7 GHz (7.125-7.425 GHz) 7 GHz (7.425-7.725 GHz) 13 GHz (12.750-13.250 GHz) 15 GHz (14.5-15.5 GHz) 18 GHz (17.7-19.7 GHz) 21 GHz (21.2-23.6 GHz) Q2.

If so, what could be the measures to mitigate such challenges? Suggestions may kindly be made with justification. (b) Carrier size 2.34 GSMA report on ‘Wireless Backhaul Evolution - Delivering next -generation connectivity’ of February 2021 mentions that the traditional microwave bands (i.e., within 6 GHz to 42 GHz) continue to have an important role to play, especially as they can cover longer distan ces with fewer hops. However, their narrower channel sizes make supporting 5G traffic challenging, so it is important that regulators support wider channels and permit operators to 30 aggregate spectrum in these bands. GSMA report also provides a table depicting typical channel size in microwave bands. As published in the GSMA report, t he following f igure shows the typical Channel Sizes, and Data Throughput in traditional microwave bands. Figure 2.6: Typical channel sizes and data throughput in traditional microwave bands, Source: GSMA 2.35 At present, in India, the carrier size followed for assignment of MWA and MWB is 28 MHz. However, TSPs can acquire more than one carrier. In case, a TSP acquires multiple carriers to meet the high -capacity requirement, one option could be the use of wider channel size (provided assigned carriers are contiguous) and the other option could be the use of carrier aggregation technique. One may contend that considering that the backhaul capacity requirement has increased manifolds, the carrier size may be increased. One could also argue that the data traffic in certain LSAs or category of LSAs is comparatively higher; therefore, for such LSAs, a larger carrier size may be advisable. Contrary view could be that a lower carrier size provides greater flexibility and TSP, anyway, has a choice to obtain multiple carriers of 28 MHz. At this point, a question arises as to what should be the carrier size for MWA and MWB bands. 2.36 Further, some of the MW A/ MWB bands are quite wide and there may be a case that the available equipment may not be supporting the entire band but part of the frequency band. In such a case, it may be desirable that if a TSP acquires more than one carrier, all the carriers are assigned in a contiguous manner to enable carrier aggregation , or use of wider channel . Further, the 31 frequency range should be such that a single equipment can cater to all the assigned carriers. 2.37 It is also noted that , DoT is presently assigning MWA/ MWB carriers on a temporary and provisional basis with certain terms and conditions, including the following: “All MWA/ MWB carrier/ spectrum allotted, as an interim measure, will be purely on temporary and provisional basis and all such allotees will have to participate in the allotment methodology as decided by the Government after considering the recommendations of TRAI on the subject.” 2.38 Therefore, the existing licensees holding MWA/ MWB carriers will have to participate in the allotment methodology as decided. For the existing TSPs using MWA and MWB carriers, change in the carriers, already in use, may not be any issue as far as the equipment is supporting the new carrier; otherwise, any change in frequency carrier could result in disruption of services or deterioration of quality of service for the customers. To avoid disruption of services due to c arrier reassignment , as per the new carrier assignment methodology, there may be a need to ensure that the newly assigned frequency carriers to a TSP are supported by the existing equipment of the TSP. One solution could be to assign the already assigned c arriers to a TSP as long as the TSP is able to acquire the required number of carriers in the new regime. In case a TSP decides to acquire a lesser number of carriers, it can be given a choice to surrender the",

Whether there is a need to 32 prescribe a different carrier size based on different LSA categories or different user categories viz. (i) TSPs with Access Service License/ Authorization, (ii) TSPs with other than Access Service License/ Authorization and (iii) other users (non -TSP, for non -commercial/ captive/ isolated use)?

Whether there is a need to assign MW A and MWB carriers in such a way that if a TSP acquires more than one carrier in a band , all assigned carriers are contiguous, and assigned frequency range (s) can be catered through a single equipment ? If yes, kindly provide details of the frequency range (s) supported by the available equipment in each band. Any other suggestion(s) may kindly be made with detailed justification? Q6. For the existing service licensees holding MW A/ MWB carriers, whether there is a need to create some specific provisions (as discussed in para 2.38 of this CP) such that if the licensee is successful in acquiring the required number of carriers through auc tion/ assignment cycle, its services are not disrupted? If yes, kindly provide a detailed response with justification. 33 (c) Maximum number of carriers per Licensee 2.40 The objective of prescribing the maximum number of carriers that a Licensee can hold is to prevent large holdings of carriers by one or a few TSPs , which may create concerns for the competition in the market. 2.41 As per the guidelines of 2015, the TSPs could be allotted a maximum of 4 MWA carriers for Metro & Category A Service Area and 3 MWA carriers for Category B and Category C Service Area. Considering the increased requirements of backhaul on account of 5G, through amendment dated 25.07.2022, DoT increased the limit of maximum number of Microwave Access carriers that can be assigned to a Telecom Service Provider with Access Service authorization/ license on provisional basis to 8 carriers for Metro & Category A Service Area and 6 carriers for Category B and Category C Service Areas. For TSPs having other than access service license/ authorization, MWA carriers are assigned on P2P link basis. In respect of MWB carriers, as per the guidelines of 2015, Microwave Backbone carrier(s) are allotted on link -to-link basis subject to availability. 2.42 TRAI in its earlier recommendations of 2014 recommended maximum number of carriers that can be assigned to a TSP in each category of LSAs based on the access spectrum held by the TSP. Considering the increasing data usage of the consumers, fiberization of cell sites has also increased over a period. High - capacity E-band has also been opened by the Government. Further, various technologies have been evolved to enhance the backhaul data throughput i.e., high throughput is possible with the s ame quantum of spectrum with use of technologies such as Cross polarization interference cancellation (XPIC13). 2.43 In view of the foregoing discussion, the stakeholders may provide their comments on the following issues. 13 XPIC involves transmitting signals on both the horizontal and verticals planes using the same radio channel and eliminating the interference from the second polarisation; doubling spectrum efficiency. 34 Issues for Consultation Q7.

In case it is decided to prescribe a ceiling on the number of MWB carriers that a TSP can hold, (a) Whether separate ceiling for each band (6 GHz, 7 GHz (7.125 - 7.425 GHz) and 7 GHz (7.425-7.725 GHz)) should be prescribed or an overall ceiling for MWB carriers should be prescribed? (b) Whether different ceiling based on the service area category i.e., Metro/ Category ‘A’ Circles/ Category ‘B’ Circles/ Category ‘C’ Circles, needs to be provided? (c) What should be the ceiling in terms of number of carriers of 28 MHz per licensee in each case i.e., band-wise ceiling and overall ceiling for each service area category for (i) TSPs with Access Service License/ Authorization , and (ii) TSPs with other than Access Service License/ Authorization? (d) Any other relevant suggestion may be made with justification. (d) Assignment methodology 2.44 The existing spectrum assignment and re-assignment mechanism of MWA and MWB carriers in 6/7/13/15/18/21 GHz bands, as informed by DoT through its letter dated 11.10.2022 is as follows: (a) Frequency assignments and re-assignments for MWA/MWB carriers to TSPs having access service license/ authorization, are being considered administratively on provisional basis as per guidelines dated 16.10.2015 (Annexure 2.2) and its addendum dated 25.07.2022 (Annexure 2.3). As per current practice, the MWA/MWB spectrum assignments to TSPs are co- terminus with the service license. The applicants (TSPs) are required to submit an undertaking, therein following conditions have been mentioned: 36 “(i) The allotment of spectrum is provisional and subject to Govt's final decision on allotment & pricing of MWA and MWB spectrum; (ii) In the event of final decision to allot spectrum only through auction process, the provisional allotment of spectrum shall be withdrawn; (iii) In case the provisional allotment of spectrum is withdrawn, payment made towards spectrum charges or part thereof shall not be refunded; (iv) In case the provisional allotment of spectrum is withdrawn, respective wireless users would obtain Non Dealer Possession Licence (NDPL) for possessing the wireless equipment or return the equipment to a DPL holder or shall be disposed off the same as per procedure. (v) The revised spectrum charges, as finally determined through market related mechanism or otherwise, as may be applicable, shall be paid by us from the date of issue of Letter for provisional allotment of spectrum.” (b) For other entities and satellite networks the frequency assignment s are being considered as per the interim policy issued fro m time to time and upon an undertaking containing, among others, that the allotment of spectrum is provisional and subject to the Government's decision on allotment and pricing of spectrum, and that in the event of the final decision to allot spectrum only through auction process, the provisional allotment of spectrum shall be withdrawn.

(Copy of the interim policy as per Annexure- 2.4) 2.45 To summarize, as per the existing framework, MWA carriers are assigned to the TSPs with Access Service License/ authorization exclusively on an LSA basis, and for other TSPs and other entities, assignments are made on P2P link basis. As regards MWB carriers, carriers are assigned on P2P link basis to all types of entities. 2.46 As already mentioned, DoT in its back reference dated 16.10.2015 had mentioned, inter-alia, that as per the present method, MWA spectrum is allotted 37 on an exclusive basis in a service area and SUC is levied on the basis of percentage of AGR, whereas MWB carriers are allotted on link basis in a service area or to another service area and not on an exclusive basis (unlike MWA spectrum). It was also mentioned b y DoT that auction of MWB carriers may result in sub-optimal use of MWB carriers as usability of those frequency spots by others will be blocked in that service area or across service areas. 2.47 As regards assignment of MWA carriers, one may contend that as MWA carriers are assigned to TSPs with access service license/ authorization on an exclusive basis on LSA basis and the same carrier cannot be assigned to another TSP in the same LSA; therefore, MWA carriers should be assigned through auction. 2.48 For TSPs other than access service license/ authorization, one may also contend that TSPs other than access service license/ authorization should also be assigned MWA carriers on an exclusive basis, similar to the way it is assigned to access service providers. In contrast, one may contend that since TSPs other than access service providers may require to establish a few links only, assignment on P2P link basis may be continued for such TSPs, provided such number of links is within the prescribed limit, beyond which, the TSP may be required to acquire spectrum through auction. Another view could be that the TSPs who may be requiring to establish only a few links could take such links on lease from the TSPs who have acquired spectrum through auction. A counter argument could be that this will result in the development of a secondary market and loss of potential revenue to the exchequer. 2.49 As regards MWB carriers, one may contend that since MWB carriers are assigned on a P2P link basis and the same carrier can be assigned to another TSP in the same LSA but with different Lat-Long combination, as long as they are not likely to cause any inter ference to one another ; therefore, administrative assignment may result in better utilization of spectrum. However, as noted by DoT in its back -reference dated 16.10.2015, there may be instances where a particular spot frequency is claimed by two licensees and therefore, there could be a case of auction. Another view could be that MWB 38 carriers may also be assigned on an LSA basis and in that case, it can be assigned through auction. 2.50 Other entities (non-TSP) may also be requiring MWA/ MWB links to connect its nodes of the network within an isolated geographical area or two or more premises occupied by such users. In such cases, it may not be feasible to assign P2P links through auction. Further to assign MWA/ MWB carriers on a P2P links basis to such users by any methodology other than auction, some carriers may have to be earmarked for such users. 2.51 It is also noted that as per the Guidelines dated 16.10.2015, a ll MWA/ MWB carrier/spectrum allotted, as an interim measure, will be purely on temporary and provisional basis and all such allottees will have to participate in the allotment methodology as decided by the Government after considering the recommendations of TRAI on the subject .

The stakeholders are requested to provide their comments on the following questions. 39 Issues for consultation Q10. Which methodology should be used for assignment of MWA carriers? Response may be provided in the table given below: User category Assignment methodology [Auction/ Administrative/ Any other (please specify)] Justification (i) TSPs with Access Service License/ Authorization (ii) TSPs with other than Access Service License/ authorization (iii) Other entities (non - TSP, for non - commercial/ captive/ isolated use) Q11. In case you are of the opinion that certain user categories should be assigned MWA carrier P2P links by any methodology other than auction, should some MWA carriers be earmarked for such users? If yes, how many carriers should be earmarked for each of such user category? Kindly justify your response. 40 Q12. Which methodology should be used for assignment of MWB carriers?

If yes, how many carriers should be earmarked for such users? Kindly justify your response. Q14. In case it is decided to assign MWA /MWB carriers to the TSPs with Access Service License/ Authorization through auction and to continue the existing P2P assignment of MWA/MWB carriers for TSPs other than Access Service License/ Authorization , who may be requiring to establish only a few links, what threshold limit in terms of number of links, may be prescribe d, beyond which, the TSPs with other than Access Service License/ Authorization should also be required to acquire MWA/ MWB carriers through auction? Kindly justify your response. 41 Q15. In case it is decided to assign MWA/ MWB carriers to all types of licensed TSPs through auction , should such TSPs be permitted to lease their spectrum acquired through auction, on P2P link basis, to other TSPs and other entities (non-TSP, for non-commercial/ captive/ isolated use) who may be requiring establishing only a few links?

As per current practice, the MWA/MWB spectrum assignments to TSPs are co -terminus with the service license. For TSPs other than access service license/ authorization and other 42 entities (non-TSP/ non -commercial isolated/ captive users ), spectrum assignment is on a P2P link basis, for which formula-based charges are payable on an annual basis. 2.54 As per a report by GSMA and ABI Research on ‘Wireless Backhaul Evolution - Delivering next -generation connectivity’ of February 2021, ABI Research conducted an analysis of the license types and license durations of the 40 countries. Accordingly, information on license duration has been summarized as per figure given below: Figure 2.7: Summary of License Duration adopted by surveyed 40 countries, Source: GSMA and ABI Research 2.55 As per the above-mentioned report, 10 - or >10 -Year licenses are the most common license duration types across the surveyed countries in 2020; accounting for 59% of the licenses surveyed. These licenses are typically sold to operators with ongoing renewals to protect their capital investment in their respective network infrastructure. GSMA report also highlights that t he long durations give incumbents extended monopolies over important portions of spectrum and this would give them undue leverage on a share of returns from new use cases, which could serve as an obstacle to innovation. GSMA report also mentions that the s hort licenses ( for one year) allow operators more flexibility in their network planning, as they are not tied down to frequency bands for a long time and this allows for quicker network development, as they can quickly move their links to different bands that have more available spectrum. 43 2.56 From the preparatory discussion held with the stakeholders, it is understood that the TSPs keep augmenting and surrendering the carriers as per their requirement. In case it is decided to assign MW A and MWB carriers through auction, it needs deliberation as to what should be the period for which spectrum should be assigned through auction i.e., the validity period. One may contend that the validity period could be kept same as that for access spectrum i.e., 20 years. Contrary view could be that considering the future uses of spectrum in these bands, a reasonable but shorter validity period, say 10 years, may be appropriate. Further, since MWA and MWB carriers are generally used where fiber has not yet been d eployed and as the rollout of newer cellular technologies will increase, the TSPs may decide to fiberize their network, which may lead to a need for surrender of MWA/ MWB carriers. For access spectrum acquired through auction held in 2022, there is a provi sion for surrender of spectrum after a lock-in period of 10 years. In case a provision for surrender of MWA and MWB carriers is created, there may be a need to prescribe some lock- in period and other terms and conditions may also have to be prescribed. 2.57 In view of the foregoing discussion, the stakeholders are requested to provide their comments to the following questions. Issues for Consultation Q17. In case it is decided to assign MWA and MWB carriers through auction, (a) What should be the validity period of the assigned spectrum? (b) Whether there is a need to create a provision for surrender of MWA / MWB carriers? If yes, what should be the lock-in period and other associated terms and conditions?

(f) Eligibility Conditions and Roll Out Obligations 2.58 As per the existing framework, and as discussed earlier as well, MWA carriers are assigned exclusively to the TSPs with Access Service License/ Authorization on LSA basis , and for TSPs with other than Access Service License/ Authorization and other entities (non-TSP isolated captive users), assignments are made on point -to-point basis. As regards MWB carriers, the carriers are assigned on point-to-point basis to all types of entities. 2.59 It needs to be deliberated that in case it is decided to assign the MWA/ MWB carriers exclusively on LSA basis through auction, which all type s of licensees/authorization holders/other entities, should be eligible to participation in the auction. Further, it needs to be deliberated as to whether any other eligibility conditions such as minimum net worth, etc. should be prescribed. 2.60 Further, in case it is decided to assign MWA/ MWB carriers exclusively to the TSPs with Access Service License/ Authorization on LSA basis and to other TSPs/ non-TSPs, there may be a need to ensure that the spectrum assigned is put to use in a timely and e fficient manner, there may be a need to prescribe some roll out obligations. 2.61 In view of the foregoing discussion, the stakeholders are requested to provide their comments to the following questions. 45 Issues for Consultation Q19. What should be the eligibility conditions and associated conditions for assignment of spectrum in 6/ 7/ 13/ 15/ 18/ 21 GHz bands ? Response may kindly be given for each user category viz.

Kindly justify your response. Q21. In case it is decided to prescribe roll out conditi ons, what should be the roll-out obligations associated with the assignment of spectrum in 6/ 7/ 13/ 15/ 18/ 21 GHz bands?

Q22. Any other suggestions relevant to assignment of spectrum for MWA and MWB in 6/ 7/ 13/ 15/ 18/ 21 GHz frequency bands, may kindly be made with detailed justification. 2.62 The following chapter examines the issues relating to assignment of spectrum in E-band and V-band. 46 CHAPTER III: EXAMINATION OF ISSUES RELATED TO ASSIGNMENT OF SPECTRUM IN E-BAND AND V-BAND A. Background 3.1 The backhaul networks ’ requirements are impacted by the technological advancements in mobile access networks. With the increase in mobile capacity and coverage owing to technological advancements and increasing digitalization, backhaul networks need to fulfill these requirements. This necessitates efficient use of the available spectrum and use of high-capacity backhaul spectrum. 3.2 Millimeter Wave (MMW) using E -Band and V -Band is a technology for high speed (~10 Gbps) high-capacity wireless links, ideal for urban areas. Using high frequency m icrowave in the E -Band (70 -80 GHz) and V-band ( 57-64 GHz) spectrum, links can be densely deployed in congested cities without interference, and without need for digging for cables and fibre optics, which can be costly, slow and highly disruptive. E band (71-76 / 81-86 GHz) 3.3 E-band frequencies are point -to-point, line of sight, radio waves in the frequency range of 71-76 GHz paired with 81-86 GHz. The unique transmission properties of very high frequency millimeter -waves enable much simpler frequency coordination, interference mitigation and path",

E band (71-76 / 81-86 GHz) 3.3 E-band frequencies are point -to-point, line of sight, radio waves in the frequency range of 71-76 GHz paired with 81-86 GHz. The unique transmission properties of very high frequency millimeter -waves enable much simpler frequency coordination, interference mitigation and path planning compared to lower frequency bands. The antennas used in E -band frequencies are highly directional. Together with the propagation limitations, wireless systems operating at the E-band frequencies are hi ghly focused, point-to-point “pencil beam” links allowing a much higher reuse of the same frequency in a given area. These millimeter-waves can support more capacity per backhaul link at a comparatively lower cost to meet broadband demand. 47 3.4 As per ETSI Whit e Paper 14 on ‘E -Band – Survey in Status of Worldwide Regulation’ released in September 2020, E -Band characteristics can cover the most popular 5G use cases, requiring high capacity over relatively short hops (densification) up to 2 km. It further mentions that E-Band is a funda mental component of the “Band and Carrier Aggregation ” (BCA) approach to satisfy use cases for up to 20 Gbps up to 10 km. 3.5 As per a report on ‘Wireless Backhaul Evolution -Delivering next -generation connectivity’ of February 2021 by GSMA and ABI Research, t he continued use of wireless backhaul will require an evolution toward higher frequency bands, which can support wider channels and have a greater total amount of spectrum available. The E-band (70/80 GHz) will be important across all regions and is expected to enjoy exceptional growth with 11.6% CAGR from 2021 to 2027. 3.6 As per Ericsson Microwave Outlook Report 202215, E-band transceivers account for 6% of the globally installed base. In 2027, E-band (70/80 GHz) will account for 25 percent of new deployments, both as standalone and in multi -band solutions. The Report mentions as below: “With this significant movement in India, as well as uptake in multiple other countries around the globe, we therefore estimate that the previous prediction of a global new deployment share of 20 percent by 2025 is still within reach and that it will continue to grow to 25 percent by 2027. This 25 percent will be a combination of links using E -band as standalone a nd E-band in multi -band configurations.” 14 https://www.etsi.org/images/files/ETSIWhitePapers/etsi-WP-37-E-Band-survey-on-Status-of- Worldwide-Regulation.pdf 15 https://www.ericsson.com/4a81b8/assets/local/reports-papers/microwave-outlook/2022/ericsson- microwave-outlook-report-2022.pdf 48 V band (57-64 GHz) 3.7 The V-band (57-64 GHz) is also used for high-capacity terrestrial millimeter wave communications systems. In addition to the high -data rates that can be accomplished in this spectrum, energy propagation in the 60 GHz band has unique characteristics that make possible many other benefits such as excellent immunity to interference, high security, and frequency re -use. The antennas used in V -band frequencies are also highly directional and together with the propagation limitations, wireless systems operating at the V -band frequencies are also highly focused, point -to-point “pencil bea m” links allowing a much higher reuse of the same frequency in a given area. 3.8 Availability of large 7 GHz bandwidth in 60 GHz band, also known as V -Band, makes it suitable for very high capacity ( e.g., 100Mbps ~ 1Gbps Ethernet systems) and short hop (1 –2 Kms) fixed wireless systems. The 60 GHz band has unique propagation characteristics with high oxygen gas absorption of 15dB/km – i.e., the radiation from a particular radio transmitter is quickly reduced. Though this limits the distances that 60 GHz links can cover, it makes these links highly immune to interference from other 60 GHz radios. 49 Figure 3.1: Attenuation of signals due to rain or oxygen absorption, Source: 6gworld16 3.9 Deployment-related details of E-band and V-band provided in Chapter II of this Consultation Paper may kindly be referred to. As can be seen from figure 2.2 of this CP, while E-band is being adopted at a fast pace, V-band does not seem to show any significant deployment for backhaul purposes. One reason for this could be the availability of a well-developed ecosystem in E-band. B.

On some of the issues, DoT sought clarification/ reconsideration on TRAI’s recommendations through back reference dated 16.10.2015. TRAI gave its response to the back -reference on 17.11.2015. Some of the key recommendations related to E -band and V -band, made through the original recommendations and response to back-reference, are reproduced below: • In order to increase broadband penetration in India, the usage of high capacity backhaul E-band (71-76 / 81-86 GHz) and V-band (57-64MHz) may be explored for allocation to the telecom service providers. • Both E-band and V-band should be opened with ‘light touch regulation’ and allotment should be on a ‘link to link basis’. The responsibility for registration and database manage ment should lie with WPC wing of DoT. For this purpose, WPC should make necessary arrangements for an online registration process by developing a suitable web portal. Responsibility for interference analysis should rest with the licensee, who needs to check the WPC link database prior to link registration (links should be protected on a “first come, first served” basis). WPC can also maintain a waiting list for the same spot. 16 https://www.6gworld.com/exclusives/guest-editorial-a-reality-check-on-ris-and-thz- communications/ 50 • Channel bandwidth for E -band (71 -76 GHz and 81 -86 GHz) should be 250MHz with a guard band of 125MHz at the top and bottom of each 5 GHz band. More than one channel can be allowed and allocated for aggregation. • Channel bandwidth for V -band (57 -64 GHz) should be 50MHz with a 100MHz guard band at the beginning of the band. More than one c hannel can be allowed and allocated for aggregation. • E-band carrier should be charged at Rs. 10,000/ - (Rs. Ten Thousand) per annum per carrier of 250 MHz each.

AG. DoT has also mentioned that the recent 3GPP Release -17 dated 12 th December 2020 envisage use of 52.6 -71 GHz (which include V -band- 57-64 GHz under consideration in India) for 5G terrestrial networks. It also uses this band for Integrated Access and Backbone (IAB). 3.15 Regarding extending the current NR operation to 71 GHz, 3GPP in its Technical Report17 noted that: “RAN carried out a Rel -16 study on NR beyond 52.6 GHz (FS_NR_beyond_52GHz) with corresponding TR in 38.807. From this study, it became apparent the global availabilit y of bands in the 52.6 GHz to 71 GHz range, most notably in the form of the original 60 GHz band (57-66 GHz) and extended 60 GHz band (57-71 GHz). Moreover, WRC19 recently identified the 66-71 GHz frequency range for IMT operation in certain regions. The proximity of this frequency range (57 -71 GHz) to FR2 and the imminent commercial opportunities for high data rate communications makes it compelling for 3GPP to address NR operation in this frequency regime. To minimize the specification burden and maximize the leverage of FR2 based implementations, 3GPP has decided to extend FR2 operation up to 71 GHz 17 3GPP TR 21.917 V17.0.1 (2023-01) 53 with the adoption of one or more new numerologies (i.e., larger subcarrier spacings). Those new numerologies were identified in the study on waveform for NR >52.6 GHz in the first half of 2020. NR -U defined procedures for operation in unlicensed spectrum were also leveraged towards operation in the unlicensed 60 GHz band.” 3.16 Thus, it can be inferred that out of the entire range from 52.6-71 GHz, ITU has so far identified only 66-71 GHz for IMT, which is not part of the V-band range mentioned under the reference by DoT. 3.17 Further, DoT in its reference dated 12.08.2022 has mentioned that while the spectrum in E and V bands should be assigned through auction for provisioning of commercial telecom services; there may be certain non -TSP/ non - commercial usages like captive/individual point-to-point/multipoint usages, which also need spectrum in these bands and where auction may not feasible. For such usages, DoT has requested to (i) assess demand through the consultation paper, and (ii) provide recommendation s on the quantum of spectrum to be earmarked for non-commercial/ captive/isolated use in E and V bands; and the methodology of assignment, where auction is not feasible and pricing for the same. 3.18 Currently, 2 carriers (paired) each of 250 MHz in E-band have been assigned to the wireless access service providers as an interim measure for backhaul use on a provisional basis. As regards V-band, no assignments have been made so far. However, there may be need for E-band and V-band backhaul spectrum by other TSPs as well. Thus, the issue",

At these higher frequencies, antennas create highly directive pencil beams that provide high gain, to compensate for high pat h loss, and high discrimination, enabling gateways to be tightly packed into favorable rain zones without suffering from co-frequency interference. 3.27 Considering that ‘the appropriate studies to determine power flux -density and equivalent isotropically radiated power limits in Article 21 for satellite services to protect the fixed service in the frequency bands 71 -76 GHz and 81-86 GHz without unduly constraining satellite systems’ has been incorporated under the preliminary Agenda Item 2.4 of WRC -2727 for the introduction of power flux - density (pfd) and equivalent isotropically radiated power (e.i.r.p.) limits in Article 21 for the frequency bands 71 -76 GHz and 81 -86 GHz in accordance with Resolution 775 (WRC‑19), one may contend that it may be appropriate to consider E-band band spectrum for satellite -based communication network at a later date, in accordance with the outcome of WRC-27. 26 https://www.microwavejournal.com/articles/36514-using-e-band-for-wideband-satcom- opportunities-and-challenges 27 https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-R/study-groups/rcpm/Pages/wrc-27-preliminary-studies.aspx 60 3.28 As regards V-band frequency range from 57 GHz to 64 GHz, as per NFAP 2022, this frequency range has not been allocat ed for commercial satellite communication services to be provided on the Earth’s Surface. Thus, prima facie, there may not be a case of satellite-based telecom networks in the frequency range mentioned by DoT in its reference, as of now. 3.29 In view of the above, the stakeholders are requested to provide their comments to the following issues: Issues for Consultation Q25. Do you agree that the issues relating to the assignment of E-band and V-band for space-based communication services and its coexistence with terrestrial networks may be taken up at a later date? If not, the concerns and measures to overcome such concerns may kindly be suggested with relevant details. (c) Band plan and Carrier size 3.30 For E-band, ITU-R Recommendation F.200628 (03/2012) recommended several combinations with channel bandwidth with guard band of 125 MHz at the top and bottom of each 5 GHz band. There are 19 channels of 250 MHz each with a duplex separation of 10 GHz between them along with separation between the blocks by 5 GHz. In addition, channel plan with duplex spacing of 2.5 GHz option has also been recommended. ITU recommendations give flexibility to the administration to decide about deployment in TDD, FDD or their mixed use of the band. Thus, both FDD and TDD configuration arrangements are possible. However, globally, FDD configuration with duplex separation of 10 GHz has been adopted. The temporary assignments made in India, have also been made with FDD configuration. 28 https://www.itu.int/dms_pubrec/itu-r/rec/f/R-REC-F.2006-0-201203-I!!PDF-E.pdf 61 Figure 3.2: Channel plan of E-band 3.31 In regard to V-band (57-64 GHz)29 the Slot arrangement defined by ITU is in multiples of 50 MHz. The initial two slots are reserved as guard bands and any channel size can be defined in multiples of 50 MHz. In total 140 slots of 50 MHz are there, 2 reserved as guard band, 138 slots of 50 MHz each are available for assignment. Figure 3.3: Channel plan of V-band 3.32 As per the ITU Recommendation, channels n = 1, 2 may be considered as guard-band (GB) towards lower band 55.78 -57 GHz, possibly subject to different coordination conditions; in this case they should only be used for temporary purposes or equipment alignment and propagation tests. In the upper band edge, there is no need for guard band because the same system might appropriately operate also in the adjacent 64 -66 GHz band. ITU recommendations provide that either TDD or FDD, may be derived by basic 29 RECOMMENDATION ITU-R F.1497-2 - Radio-frequency channel arrangements for fixed wireless systems operating in the band 55.78-66 GHz 62 channels aggregation.

Figure given below shows the typical Channel Sizes, Data Throughput in traditional microwave bands, as published in the report. Figure 3.4: Typical Channel Sizes and Data Throughput in E and V bands 3.34 DoT, in view of increased backhaul capacity requirements of TSPs with Access Service License/ Authorization and having Access Spectrum in the IMT bands, especially on account of 5G, decided to allot carriers in E-band spectrum for the purpose of backhaul on interim basis. For this, DoT issued guidelines for allotment of E-band (71-76/ 81-86 GHz) carriers on 25.07.2022 (copy enclosed as Annexure 3.1). According to these guidelines: (1) TSPs would be allotted a maximum of two carriers of 250 MHz each (paired) bandwidth in E -band (71 -76/ 81-86) GHz for their backhaul purpose in the LSAs where they are holding Access Spectrum in IMT bands. (2) All E-band carriers assigned, as an interim measure, will be purely on temporary and provisional basis and all such assignees will have to participate in the auction and/ or any other assignment methodology, as 63 decided by the Government after considering the TRAI’s recommendations. (3) The E- band carriers, assigned as an interim measure, will stand reverted back to the Government, after a period of three months from the date of finalization of results in case such assignees fail to get back the carriers/ spectrum provisionally assigned as an interim measure. (4) Any misuse, i.e., use of E-band carriers allotted for purpose(s) other than backhaul will lead to immediate withdrawal of these carriers and invocation of relevant terms and conditions of the UL/ UASL -Access Service Authorization. 3.35 So far, E-band carriers have been assigned to 2 TSPs and both have taken 500 MHz paired spectrum [ 2 carriers of 250 MHz (paired) ]. V-band has not been assigned so far in India. As shown by the above figure, typical channel size for E-band is 500/1000 MHz and for V -band it is 100 MHz. While larger channel size prevent s fragmentation of spectrum, small er channel size provide s flexibility to the TSPs. The question arises is what should be the carrier size for assignment of spectrum in E-band and V-band. 3.36 As already mentioned, DoT is presently assigning E -band carriers on a temporary and provisional basis with certain terms and conditions. Accordingly, the existing licensees holding E-band carriers are required to participate in the auction and/or any other assignment methodology, as decided. Therefore, since the TSPs will have to participate in the new spectrum assignment methodology, there may be a case that a TSP may not be assigned the same frequency carrier. From the preparatory discussion with the OEM s, it is understood that generally E-band equipment support the entire band. However, it needs to be deliberated that whether any change in the existing carrier frequencies is likely to cause any disruption of services to the consumers or some specific mea sures need to be taken so that a TSP is given a choice to retain the same frequency carrier as long as the TSP is able to acquire the required number of carriers in the new regime. 64 3.37 In this background, the Authority solicits comments of stakeholders on the following set of questions: Issues for Consultation Q26. Whether it will be appropriate to continue with the Frequency Division Duplexing (FDD) based configuration as adopted for the provisional assignment of E-band carriers or Time Division Duplexing (TDD) based configuration should be adopted ? Kindly justify your response. Q27. Whether Frequency Division Duplexing (FDD) or Time Division Duplexing (TDD) based configuration should be adopted for V -band carriers?

    "text": "mea sures need to be taken so that a TSP is given a choice to retain the same frequency carrier as long as the TSP is able to acquire the required number of carriers in the new regime. 64 3.37 In this background, the Authority solicits comments of stakeholders on the following set of questions: Issues for Consultation Q26. Whether it will be appropriate to continue with the Frequency Division Duplexing (FDD) based configuration as adopted for the provisional assignment of E-band carriers or Time Division Duplexing (TDD) based configuration should be adopted ? Kindly justify your response. Q27. Whether Frequency Division Duplexing (FDD) or Time Division Duplexing (TDD) based configuration should be adopted for V -band carriers? In case you are of the opinion that FDD based configuration should be adopted, detailed submissions may be made with band plan, ecosystem availability, and international scenario. Q28. What should be the carrier size for assignment of spectrum in E-band (71-76/81-86 GHz) and V-band (57-64 GHz)? Whether there is a need to prescribe a different carrier size based on different LSA categories or different user categories viz. (i) TSPs with Access Service License/ Authorization, (ii) TSPs other than Access Service License/ Authorization and (iii) other users (non -TSP, for non -commercial/ captive/ isolated use)? If yes, suggestions may be made with detailed justification. Q29. Whether there is a need to assign spectrum in E-band and V-band in such a way that if a TSP acquires more than one carrier, all the assigned carriers to a TSP are contiguous? Kindly justify your response. Q30. Since E-band carriers will be reassigned as per the assignment methodology that will be finalized, to avoid any disruption of services to the consumers of the existing TSPs holding E -band carriers, whether there is a need to create a provision such that the TSP is 65 given a choice to retain the same frequenc y carrier as long as such TSP is able to acquire the carriers in the new regime? K indly justify your response. (d) Maximum number of carriers per Licensee 3.38 As already mentioned in Chapter II of this CP, the objective of prescribing the maximum number of carriers that a Licensee can hold is to prevent large holdings of carriers by one or a few TSPs, which otherwise, may create concerns for the competition in the market. 3.39 As per the DoT guidelines for allotment of E-band (71-76/ 81-86 GHz) carriers dated 25.07.2022 TSPs with Access Service authorization/ license can apply for a maximum of two carriers of 250 MHz each (paired) spectrum in E -band for their backhaul purpose in the LSAs where they are holding Access Spectrum in IMT bands. However, with increasing data traffic, the wireless access service providers may be requiring more than 500 MHz (paired) spectrum in E -band. In addition to wireless access service providers, backhaul spectrum in E -band and V-band may also be required by TSPs other than wireless access service providers. 3.40 Further, as mentioned by DoT in its reference dated 12.08.2022, there may be certain non-TSP/ non-commercial usages like captive/ individual point to point/ multipoint usages, which also need spectrum in these bands, and where auction may not be feasible. Thus, some carriers may have to be earmarked for such users. 3.41 Considering that 19 carriers of 250 MHz (paired) spectrum are available in E - band and 138 carriers of 50 MHz (unpaired) spectrum are available in V-band, the issue arises as to what should be the maximum number of carriers per TSP/ entity in each LSA. 66 3.42 In view of the foregoing discussion, the stakeholders may provide their comments on the following issues. Issues for Consultation Q31. Whether there is a need to prescribe the maximum number of carriers that can be held by a TSP in E-band and V-band? Kindly justify your response. Q32. In case it is decided to prescribe a ceiling on the number of carriers that a licensee can hold in E-band and V-band, (a) Whether different ceiling s based on the service area category i.e., Metro/ Category ‘A’ Circles/ Category ‘B’ Circles/ Category ‘C’ Circles, need to be prescribed? (b) Considering a carrier of 250 MHz (paired) spectrum for E-band, and 50 MHz (unpaired) spectrum for V -band, what should be the ceiling in terms of the number of carriers per licensee for each service area category for (i) TSPs with access service License/ authorization holding IMT spectrum, (ii) TSPs with access service License/ a uthorization not holding IMT spectrum, and (iii) TSPs with other than Access Service License/ Authorization? (c) Any other relevant suggestion may be made with justification. 67 (e) Assignment methodology 3.43 As already mentioned, DoT, in view of the increased backhaul capacity requirements of TSPs with Access Service authorization/ license and having",

(c) Any other relevant suggestion may be made with justification. 67 (e) Assignment methodology 3.43 As already mentioned, DoT, in view of the increased backhaul capacity requirements of TSPs with Access Service authorization/ license and having Access Spectrum in the IMT bands, especially on account of 5G, decided to allot carriers in E-band spectrum for the purpose of backhaul on interim basis. For this, DoT issued guidelines for allotment of E-band (71-76/ 81-86 GHz) carriers on 25.07.202230. Accordingly, mobile service providers can apply for allotment of a maximum of two carriers of 250 MHz each (paired) bandwidth in E -band (71-76/81-86) GHz for their backhaul purpose in the LSAs where they are holding Access Spectrum in IMT bands. However, such adminis trative assignment of E-band carriers is temporary and provisional , and all such assignees will have to participate in the auction and/ or any other assignment methodology, as decided by the Government after considering the TRAI’s recommendations. 3.44 It is also to note that as per the Guidelines dated 25.07.2022, ‘[a]ll E-band carriers assigned, as an interim measure, will be purely on temporary and provisional basis and all such assignees will have to participate in the auction and/or any other assignment methodology, as decided by the Government after considering the recommendations of the TRAI in this regard’ and ‘[t]he E- band carriers, assigned as an interim measure, will stand reverted back to the Government, after a period of three months from the date of finalization of results of aforesaid activity as detailed/stipulated in para 5 above in case such assignees fail to get back the carriers/ spectrum provisionally assigned as an interim measure.’ 3.45 DoT in its reference dated 12.08.2022 has mentioned that the matter of E-band and V-band spectrum assignment was deliberated in DoT, and it emerged that 30 DoT’s Guidelines for allotment of E-band (71-76/81-86 GHz) carriers to Telecom Service Providers (TSPs) with Access Service authorization/license and having Access Spectrum in IMT bands dated 25.07.2022. [https://dot.gov.in/sites/default/files/Guidelines%20for%20allotment%20of%20E- band%20dated%2025%2007%202022%20signed.pdf] 68 while the spectrum in E and V bands should be assigned through auction for provisioning of commercial telecom services; there may be certain non -TSP/ non-commercial usages like captive/individual point to point/multipoint usages, which also need spectrum in these bands and where auction may not feasible. 3.46 In response to TRAI letter dated 09.09.2022 seeking, inter-alia, rationale for arriving at the conclusion that E & V bands should be assigned through auction, DoT through its letter dated 11.10.2022 has mentioned that the large reusability/small link size, dense deployment, makes E & V bands more suitable for LSA wise assignment rather than link by link assignme nt as the accounting/administration of large number of links in these bands and charging therein is not feasible in Indian context. As both E & V band are to be assigned on LSA/pan India basis, hence, auction of these spectrum bands on LSA basis is feasible and therefore, such spectrum may be assigned through competitive bidding/auction in accordance with opinion of Ld. AG. 3.47 Therefore, the first question arises as to whether spectrum in E -band and V- band should be assigned on LSA basis as defined for Access services Authorization in the Unified License or on pan -India basis. One may contend that since the service license for access services is on LSA basis, spectrum should also be assigned on LSA basis. However, in case spectrum in E -band and V-band is also required by TSPs other than access service providers, the licensed service for such TSPs may not be same as that for access service providers. 3.48 In case spectrum in E and V bands is decided to be assigned exclusively on LSA basis, one may contend that spectrum in E-band and V-band should be assigned through auction. Assignment of spectrum in E & V bands to TSPs other than access service license/ authorization involves similar issues as discussed for MWA in para 2.48 of this CP. 3.49 Further, as mentioned by DoT in its reference dated 12.08.2022, there may be certain non-TSP/ non-commercial usages like captive/ individual point-to-point/ multipoint usages, which also need spectrum in these bands,",

Such users may requir e E-band and V -band links to connect the nodes of the network within an isolated geographical area or two or more premises occupied by such user. Further to assign E-band and V-band carriers on P2P links basis to such users by any methodology other than auction, some carriers may have to be earmarked for such users. 3.50 Further, DoT through its reference dated 12.08.2022 has also sought TRAI recommendations on scope of services/ usages for spectrum in E-band and V- band. As per the guidelines issued by DoT for allotment of E-band (71-76/ 81- 86 GHz) carriers dated 25.07.2022, E -band carriers are assigned to the TSPs with access service license/authorization for backhaul purpose in the LSAs the TSP is holding Access Spectrum in IMT bands. The guideline further states that: “Any misuse, i.e. use of E -band carriers allotted for purpose(s) other than backhaul will lead to immediate withdrawal of these carriers and invocation of relevant terms and conditions of the UL/ UASL-Access Service Authorization.” 3.51 In this background, the Authority solici ts comments of stakeholders on the following set of questions: Issues for consultation Q33. Which methodology should be used for assignment of spectrum in E- band and V -band? Response may be provided in the table given below: User category Assignment methodology [Auction/ Administrative/ Any other (please specify)] Justification (i) TSPs with Access Service License/ authorization (ii) TSPs with other than Access Service License/authorization 70 (iii) Other entities (non - TSP, for non - commercial/ captive/ isolated use) Q34. In case you are of the opinion that certain user categories should be assigned spectrum in E -band and V -band for P2P links by any methodology other than auction, should some carriers be earmarked for such users? If yes, how many carriers should be earmarked for such users? Kindly justify your response. Q35. In case it is decided to assign spectrum in E & V bands to the TSPs with Access Service License/ Authoriz ation through auction and adopt P2P links assignment for TSPs other than Access Service License/ Authorization, who may be requiring to establish only a few links, what threshold limit in terms of number of links, may be prescribed, beyond which, the TSPs with other than Access Service License/ Authorization should be required to acquire spectrum in E- band and V -band bands through auction? Kindly justify your response. Q36. In case it is decided to assign spectrum in E & V bands to all the TSPs through auction, should such TSPs be permitted to lease their spectrum acquired through auction, on P2P link basis, to the TSPs and other entities for non-commercial/ captive/ isolated use, who may be requiring to establish only a few links? What could be the regulatory issues and potential misuse of such a regime? What measures could be put in place to mitigate the concerns? Kindly justify your response. Q37. In case it is decided to assign spectrum in E-band (71-76/ 81-86 GHz) and V-band (57-64 GHz) on an exclusive basis, should the spectrum be assigned on an LSA basis, or pan-India basis or for any other geographic area should be defined? Kindly justify your response. 71 Q38. What should be the scope of services/ usages for spectrum in E-band (71-76/ 81 -86 GHz) and V -band (57 -64 GHz) assigned through auction or any other assignment methodology? Kindly justify your response. Q39.

Further, t he E - band carriers, assigned as an interim measure, will stand reverted back to the Government, after a period of three months from the date of finalization of results in case such assignees fail to get back the carriers/ spectrum provisionally assigned as an interim measure. Thus, it can be inferred that validity period has not been defined for E-band spectrum assigned provisionally. As already mentioned, so far, spectrum in V -band (57-64 GHz) has not been assigned to the TSPs. 3.53 For providing certainty to the TSPs, it may be appropriate to keep a reasonably longer validity period. Backhaul spectrum is used as a substitute for OFC in certain areas, which is a business decision based on several factors already 72 discussed in chapter-II of this CP. One may contend that since Access spectrum is assigned for a period of 20 years, backhaul spectrum should also be assigned for a period of 20 years. However, as highlighted in the report on ‘Wireless Backhaul Evolution-Delivering next-generation connectivity’ of February 2021 by GSMA and ABI Research, the long durations give incumbents extended monopolies over important portions of spectrum; this would give them undue leverage on a share of returns from new use cases, which could serve as an obstacle of innovation. The Report also mentions that the short licenses allow operators more flexibility in their network planning, as they are not tied down to frequency bands for a long time; this allows for quicker network development, as they can quickly move their links to different bands that have more available spectrum. 3.54 In case it is decided to assign spectrum in E-band and V-band through auction, it needs deliberation as to what should be the period for which spectrum should be assigned through auction i.e., the validity period. Further, since backhaul spectrum is used where fiber has not yet been deployed and as the rollout of newer cellular technologies will increase, the TSPs may decide to fiberize their network, thereby surrendering spectrum in E & V bands. For access spectrum acquired through auction held in 2022, there is a provision for surrender of spectrum after a lock-in period of 10 years. In case a provision for surrender of E & V band carriers is created, there may be a need to prescribe some lock -in period and other terms and conditions may also have to be prescribed. 73 3.55 In view of the foregoing discussion, the stakeholders are requested to provide their comments to the following questions. Issues for Consultation Q40. In case it is decided to assign spectrum in E & V bands through auction, (a) What should be the validity period? (b) Whether there is a need to create a provision for surrender of E & V band? If yes, what should be the lock -in period and other terms and conditions?

Further, it needs to be deliberated as to whether any other eligibility conditions such as minimum net worth, holding IMT spectrum, etc. should be prescribed. 3.58 Further, in case it is decided to assign spectrum in E -band and V -band exclusively to the TSPs on LSA basis, there may be a need to ensure that the spectrum assigned is put to use in a timely and efficient manner, there may be a need to prescribe some roll out obligations. 3.59 In view of the foregoing discussion, the stakeholders are requested to provide their comments to the following questions. Issues for Consultation Q42. What should be the eligibility conditions and associated conditions for assignment of spectrum in E -band (71 -76/81-86 GHz) and V -band (57-64 GHz)?

What provisions should be prescribed for non- fulfilment of the prescribed roll-out obligations? Response may kindly be g iven for each user category viz.

(h) Feasibility for allowing low power, indoor, consumer -device-to- device usages on license exempt basis 3.60 DoT through its reference dated 12.08.2022 has mentioned that in V-band the the device/chipset eco-system supporting various technologies for data transfer between consumer's devices such as smartphones, camera, laptops etc. has developed. The technologies used for such devices are designed for short - range, indoor, interference -tolerant applications. Therefore, while the V band spectrum can be assigned through auction for establishment of indoor/outdoor telecom networks, allowing low power, indoor usages of V band on license - exempt basis for consumer-device-to-consumer-device data transfer may go a long way in serving greater public interest and realizing significant socio - economic gains. 3.61 With the above view, DoT has requested TRAI to provide its recommendations on the feasibility, including technical parameters, for allowing low power, indoor, consumer device-to-consumer device usages on license -exempt basis, in parallel to use of the auction acquired spectrum by telecom service providers for establishment of terrestrial and/ or satellite-based telecom networks, in part or full V band. 3.62 ITU in its recommendation on ‘Multiple Gigabit Wireless Systems in frequencies around 60 GHz ’31, provided general characteristics and radio interface standards for Multiple Gigabit Wireless Systems (MGWS) in frequencies around 60 GHz. MGWS radiocommunication networks can be used in short-range, line- of-sight and non-line-of-sight circumstances with traditional WLAN topologies. 31 ITU-R M.2003-2 (01/2018) [https://www.itu.int/dms_pubrec/itu-r/rec/m/R-REC-M.2003-2-201801- I!!PDF-E.pdf ] 76 MGWS systems can also be used in very short -range high-rate proximity communications where the radio range is a few centimeters with devices pairing point-to-point in close proximity of each other.

Some of the key points of ITU Recommendations are given below: • For WLAN, total communication range and performance will vary depending on system design (e.g. number of antenna elements) as well as the environment, but multiple gigabit performance is typically expected at ranges around 10 m for in-room use when devices typically possess a few (≤ 3) dozen antenna elements, to a few hundred meters for outdoor use when devices can be equipped with several (≥ 6) dozen antenna elements. • For close proximity communication, performance up to 100 Gbps is expected with range of 10 cm or less (devices nearly touching) with transient connections (rapid setup and teardown); Close proximity devise typically will use a single antenna element and very low transmit power. • Regarding the spectrum, a mini mum of 7 GHz contiguous spectrum in the 57-71 GHz is needed to satisfy the requirements of the applications envisioned to be used in this spectrum. This would allow up to six channels for flexibility and improved connectivity. Furthermore, for single channels, a channel bandwidth of 2160 MHz allows simpler modulation schemes to achieve multi-Gbps data rates, which is suitable for adoption by low power devices such as smartphones, tablets, etc. To achieve greater capacity, single channels are bonded as an in teger multiple of 2160 MHz to enable coexistence with 2160 MHz systems. • It is important that MGWS standards employ the same channelization in order to promote better coexistence. Centre frequencies for single channels are recommended to be at 58.32, 60.48, 62.64, 64.80 GHz, 66.96 GHz, and 69.12 GHz. For bonded channels, centre frequencies 77 depend on how many single channels are bonded but need to be uniformly spaced with respect to the single channel centre frequencies. • For Channel access schemes, basic acce ss scheme is time division multiple access (TDMA), which is necessary to deal with the challenges of operation in 60 GHz, the directional nature of communication, and applications such as wireless display. TDMA can provide the necessary bandwidth guarantee to applications sensitive to quality of service. Contention-based access, such as provided by in Wi -Fi, should also be supported for usages including web browsing and file transfer. However, instead of being the basic access scheme, contention -based acces s should be used within periods of time allocated in the TDMA channel access infrastructure. • For improved coexistence, it is important that all MGWS utilize the same channelization. For example, channelization of IEEE Std 802.11-2016532, IEEE Std 802.15.3-2016633, and IEEE Std 802.15.3e -2017734 defines a channel bandwidth of 2160 MHz. Further, apart from the above, standards such as ETSI EN 302 567 v2.1.1, Wi -Fi Alliance Protocol Adaptation Layer, ISO/IEC 13156 also address MGWS specifications. 3.63 It can be seen from the above that channel Centre frequencies for single channels recommended by ITU are 58.32 GHz, 60.48 GHz, 62.64 GHz, 64.80 GHz, 66.96 GHz, and 69.12 GHz. Considering that V -band frequency range referred by DoT is 57 -64 GHz, first 3 channels of 2.16 GHz each as recommended by ITU for Multiple Gigabit Wireless Systems , as shown below, are under consideration: 32 IEEE Standard for Telecommunications and Information Exchange Between Systems – Local and Metropolitan Area Networks. 33 IEEE Standard for High Data Rate Wireless Multi-Media Networks 34 IEEE Standard for High Data Rate Wireless Multi-Media Networks Amendment: High-Rate Close Proximity Point-to-Point Communications. 78 Channel Start frequency (GHz) End frequency (GHz) Centre Frequency (GHz) 1 57.24 59.40 58.32 2 59.4 61.56 60.48 3 61.56 63.72 62.64 3.64 As already mentioned, DoT has sought TRAI recommendations on feasibility, including technical parameters, for allowing low power, indoor, consumer device-to-consumer device usages on license -exempt basis, in parallel to use of the auction acquired spectrum by telecom service providers for establishment of terrestrial and/ or satellite-based telecom networks, in part or full V band. 3.65 In view of the foregoing discussion, the stakeholders are requested to provide their comments to the following questions.

Suggestions may kindly be made with supporting justification and international scenario. Q47. Any other suggestions relevant to assignment of spectrum in E-band (71-76/81-86 GHz) and V-band (57-64 GHz) may kindly be made with detailed justification. 3.66 The following chapter examines the issues relating to valuation and pricing of E-band, V-band, MWA and MWB. 80 CHAPTER IV: VALUATION AND PRICING OF E-BAND, V-BAND, MWA AND MWB A. E-band and V-Band 4.1 The Authority in its 2014 Recommendations on “ Allocation and Pricing of Microwave Access (MWA) and Microwave Backbone (MWB) RF carriers ”35 recommended to open both E-band and V-band with ‘light touch regulation’ and allotment on ‘link to link’ basis considering that light licensing would facilitate speedy allocation of the carriers and low pricing would enable operators to roll out the techn ology faster with lower CAPEX and OPEX. The Authority recommended the following: • E-band carrier be charged at Rs. 10,000/- per annum per carrier of 250 MHz each. More than one channel can be allocated and allowed for aggregation. There should be initial promotional discount of 50% for three years from the date of allocation of first carrier in this band. • In case of charging of V-band carriers since there are limitations in this band, the same be charged for Rs. 1,000/- per annum per carrier of 50MHz each. More than one channel can be allocated and allowed for aggregation. There should be initial promotional discount of 50% for three years from the date of allocation of first carrier in this band. 4.2 In view of the increased backhaul capacity requirements of Tel ecom Service Providers (TSPs) with Access service authorization/license and having Access Spectrum in the IMT bands, especially on account of 5G, DoT has decided to allot carriers in E-band spectrum for the purpose of backhaul on interim basis. Recently, vide “Guidelines for allotment of E -band (71-76/81-86 GHz) carriers to Telecom Service Providers (TSPs) with Access Service authorization/license and having Access Spectrum in IMT bands” 36 dated 25.07.2022, DoT has prescribed that for each E-band carrier of 250 MHz paired bandwidth, spectrum 35 https://trai.gov.in/sites/default/files/MW%20Reco%20Final29082014.pdf 36 https://dot.gov.in/sites/default/files/Guidelines%20for%20allotment%20of%20E- band%20dated%2025%2007%202022%20signed.pdf 81 charges will be levied @ 0.15% of Adjusted Gross Revenue of the TSPs in the interim period, which will be adjusted/recalculated retrospectively (from date of provisional assignment) based upon the pricing decided finally. B. Microwave Access (MWA) and Microwave Backbone (MWB) RF carriers 4.3 The Authority in its recommendation dated 29th August 2014 on “Allocation and Pricing of Microwave Access (MWA) and Microwave Backbone (MWB) RF carriers”37 had recommended the following: - There should not be any upfront charges for the assignment of MWA and MWB carriers. The AGR based spectrum charging mechanism for MWA carriers should be continued. However, for MWB carriers, the charging should be done on a link- to-link basis as is being done for all other terrestrial MW links. Spectrum charges for MWB link shall be Rs. 13,900 per KM per annum. The following spectrum charges for MWA carriers (28 MHz paired) should be made applicable for access service providers. No. of MWA carriers assigned to a TSP Applicable Percentage of AGR as spectrum charge for MWA",

The Authority was o f the view that using OFC for backhaul connectivity is a better option than using spectrum due to the inherent advantages such as OFC provides better quality and reliable connectivity and scalable bandwidth, the TSP not required to incur any capital/O&M expenditure if it chooses to take the circuit on lease basis and the leasing option is quick to implement whereas MW links installation take some time in processes like assignment of MWB carriers, SACFA clearance etc. The Authority while using the ceiling ta riff prescribed in telecom tariff order (57 th amendment) for 30 km distance, applied relevant factor and deducted the terminal costs and O&M charges, a spectrum charge of Rs. 13,900 per KM per annum for the MWB link was calculated. 4.5 Presently, charging for MWA as well as MWB spectrum assignments is done on a percentage of AGR basis. While spectrum for MWB is assigned on point -to- point basis, the applicable rate as a percentage of AGR does not vary with the number of P2P links demanded/ assigned in a carrier to a TSP. 4.6 For other entities i.e., TSPs other than Access Service License/ Authorization and non-TSP isolated captive users, MWB/ MWA carriers are assigned on a point-to-point (P2P) link basis. Charging for such spectrum assignments is done on a formula basis. 4.7 The spectrum charges for MWA/MWB for TSPs are levied as per OM dated J - 14025/200(11)-NT dated 03.11.2006 (Annexure 4.1) and J - 14025/200(11)/06-NT dated 10.11.2008 (Annexure 4.2 ). The spectrum charging for captive networks are being levied as per OM no. P-11014/34/2009- PP(II), (IV) dated 22.03.2012 (Annexure 4.3). 83 4.8 Further the frequency assignments and re-assignments for MWA/MWB carriers to TSPs having access service license/ authorization , are being considered administratively on provisional basis as per guidelines dated 16.10.2015 and its addendum dated 25.07.2022. The applicants (TSPs) are required to submit an undertaking with the following conditions: \"(i) The allotment of spectrum is provisional and subject to Govt's final decision on allotment & pricing of MWA and MWB spectrum; (ii) In the event of final decision to allot spectrum only through auction process, the provisional allotment of spectrum shall be withdrawn; (iii) In case the provisional allotment of spectrum is withdrawn, payment made towards spectrum charges or part thereof shall not be refunded; (iv) In case the provisional allotment of spectrum is withdrawn, respective wireless users would obtain Non Dealer Possession Licence (NDPL) for possessing the wireless equipment or return the equipment to a DPL holder or shall be disposed off the same as per procedure.

D. Valuation of Spectrum 4.10 In the past, the Authority for the purpose of valuation and fixation of reserve price has used various models such as production function model, producer surplus model, revenue surplus model, Multiple regression model etc. These models rely on an extensive dataset regarding certain market a nd financial parameters related to the particular band, previous spectrum holding of the particular band etc. However, the E band, V band, MWA, MWB may be contemplated for auction in India for the first time. There is no historical auction data available t o conduct comparative analysis involving auction determined prices in India. Hence, all the valuation methodologies used in IMT recommendations cannot be used for valuation of E band, V band, MWA, MWB due to lack of data related to the spectrum bands being put to auction. The Authority intends to explore the following possible methodologies for the valuation of these bands: • Technical/Spectral efficiency approach • Current spectrum charges • International benchmarking 85 4.10.1 Technical/Spectral efficiency approach • An alternative approach for valuation of these bands could be based on comparative values that can be achieved by using relative spectral efficiency approach where characteristics like capacity of a particular band can be compared with the same characteristics of another spectrum band and a spectral efficiency factor can be derived as a ratio. • The authority in the past has used spectral efficiency factor for valuation of spectrum. It can be explored if the same is available in respect of E, V, MWA, MWB bands also and can be utilized as a basis for valuation of these bands. • Moreover, the auction determined prices of mmWave bands for IMT/5G, across all the 22 licensed service areas is available from the recently concluded August 2022 IMT/5G auctions. It can be explored whether these prices can be used as a basis for valuation of E and V bands. 4.10.2 Current Spectrum Charges • As stated in para----, presently spectrum for E, V, MWA and MWB bands are being assigned adminis tratively. Spectrum charges for E -Band, MWA, MWB are levied as a percentage of AGR. • It can be explored if the current spectrum charges being paid by operators may be used as a basis for valuation of spectrum in E, V, MWA and MWB bands. 4.10.3 International benchmarking 4.10.3.1 Using some other alternative approaches such as international benchmarking can also be explored for these bands. The international spectrum charges/price can serve as a basis for valuation of E, V, MWA, MWB bands. For this, it might be useful to obtain insights regarding the assignment and spectrum pricing mechanism followed internationally. The 86 following sections deal with the assignment and spectrum charging mechanism being followed in some countries. E- Band 4.10.3.2 The licensing regime adopted for the allocation of E -Band in most of the countries is based on light licensing regulation38. As per the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI)’s “E -Band and V -Band - Survey on status of worldwide regulation, 2020” database 39 spanning a total of 109 countries, the E - Band in open for fixed services in 86 countries. Since the licens ing methods vary across countries, for comparison purpose ETSI has estimated the fees considering the specific channel case of 250MHz/Year. The cross-country fees analysis and further insights based on the international data have been presented as follows: Particulars Number of Countries Countries Surveyed 109 E- Band",

Ofcom opened the spectrum in the 59 - 64 GHz band for Fixed Wireless Systems (FWS) and to combine this with the existing 57 - 59 GHz band under one overall license exempt authorization approach for FWS 40. The 40 https://www.ofcom.org.uk/consultations-and-statements/category-1/59_64ghz 88 60GHz band is also unlicensed in Europe 41. Moreover, frequencies in this band are also license -exempt in Australia, Canada, Japan, Republic of Korea and the United States. 4.10.3.4 However, DoT in its letter dated 11.10.2022 has mentioned that [r]egarding V band s pectrum, some countries had delicensed it during 2010 to 2014, when there was no visibility on the use of this spectrum for 5G/lMT and also the alternate telecommunications technologies like Wi-Fi have evolved to make it an equivalent technology to 4G/5G. Further, during last 7 -8 years, technologies have developed which compete with 4G/5G/IMT. Therefore, hardly any country has delicensed V -band post TRAI's recommendations in 2014 -2015 as 5G & equivalent technologies have been developed in these bands. Furth er, these band may also play key role in 6G technology. MWA and MWB Bands 4.10.3.5 Internationally the assignment of the spectrum for the microwave bands is based on link-to-link basis and is being done administratively. The annual spectrum fee/charge is calculated based on bandwidth factor, frequency factor, other technical factors etc. The countries have prescribed formulae for calculation of spectrum fee/charge, however, the same also varies from country to country. E. Single vs. Multiple approaches 4.11 Further, the Authority, since September 2013, has taken a consistent view that instead of depending on the valuation arrived at using any single approach, it would be better to rely on a number of such approaches to arrive at a final reasonable valuation and then determine reserve price based on such valuation. Accordingly, the Authority has been using various approaches to arrive at the valuation of different spectrums bands and to determine the reserve price of 41 https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Worldwide-allocations-of-60-GHz-unlicensed-bands-Even- though-III-V-technologies-such-as_fig1_221915925 89 different spectrum bands for the auction of variou s bands of spectrum from time to time. All of these valuation approaches have their merits as well as demerits and it would be appropriate to rely on a number of such approaches to arrive at a final reasonable valuation rather than depending on the valuation arrived at using any one approach. The Authority in its spectrum valuation exercises has used probabilistic average valuation (simple mean) of the valuations obtained through the different approaches attempted for valuation of a particular spectrum band . Taking into account the principle of equal probability of occurrence of each valuation, will it be appropriate to take the average valuation (simple mean) of the valuations obtained through the different approaches attempted for valuation of a",

F. Reserve price estimation 4.12 For arriving at the reserve prices, the Authority in its recommendation dated 11.04.2022 had primarily set reserve price equal to 70% of the mean of value the spectrum derived from all possible approaches. 4.13 A reserve price is the starting point for an ascending price auction and bidding is the means to true price discovery. It ensures a minimum guaranteed amount for the owner/ seller of goods and prevents excessive bargaining in the auction process. The reserve price set at too low level is inefficient in deterring collusion and if set at a too high level it can negatively impact participation in the auction. Thus, to ensure efficiency of the auction process, setting of reserve price at an optimal level is a prerequisite. G. Payment Terms 4.14 DoT vide its reference has requested to provide recommendations on payment terms as well. It must be noted that the Notice Inviting Applications specify various aspects/parameters related to payment terms such as upfront payments, prepayment options, number of ins tallments, moratorium period, 90 rate of discount etc. As can be seen from the above, DoT guidelines dated 25.07.2022 specify certain parameters related to payment terms such as number of installments within a financial year for payment of spectrum charges, interest on delayed payments etc. for administrative allotment of spectrum based on annual charges, however it may be noted that if spectrum is allocated through auction the payments terms will be distinct. H. Issues for consultation: 4.15 In view of the discussi ons above in E -band, V -band, MWA and MWB, the following issues arise for consultation ( stakeholders are requested to respond to the questions / sub-questions separately): Q48. In case it is decided for assignment of spectrum on administrative basis, what should be the spectrum charging mechanism for assignment of spectrum for i) E band ii) V band iii) MWA carriers and iv) MWB carriers separately for each of the following three categories: - a) TSPs with Access Service License/ Authorization b) TSPs with other than Access Service License/ Authorization c) Other entities (non-TSP, for non-commercial/ captive/ isolated use) Q49. Should the auction determined prices of spectrum bands for IMT/5G services be used as the basis for valuation of: i) E band ii) V band iii) MWA carriers and iv) MWB carriers 91 Please justify your responses. Q50. Whether the value of spectrum in i) E band ii) V band iii) MWA carriers and iv) MWB carriers be derived by relating it to the value of other bands by using spectral efficiency factor? If yes, with which spectrum band, should this band be related and what efficiency factor or formula should be used? Please justify your suggestions. Q51. Should the current method of levying spectrum fees/charges for E band, MWA carriers and MWB carriers on AGR basis as followed by DoT, serve as a basis for the purpose of valuation of i) E band ii) V band iii) MWA carriers and iv) MWB carriers If yes, please specify in detail what methodology is to be used in this regard? Q52. Should the International administrative annual spectrum charges estimated based on specific channel case (250 MHZ/Year) of E -Band serve as a basis for the purpose of valuation of i) E band ii) V bands Please provide detailed justification. If the answer to the question is yes, should the administrative annual spectrum charges be normalized for cross country differences? Please specify in detail the methodology to be used in this regard. 92 Q53. Should international benchmarking by comparing the auction determined price in countries where auctions have been concluded in E and V bands, if any, be used for arriving at the value of i) E band ii) V band If yes, then what methodology can",

DoT’s Reference Dated 02.08.2023 1.1 The Department of Telecommunications (DoT), Ministry of Communications, Government of India, through the letter No. L -14006/01/2023-IMT dated 02.08.2023 (Annexure-1.1) (hereinafter, also referred to as “Reference dated 02.08.2023”) sent a reference under the terms of clause 11(1)(a) of TRAI Act, 1997 (as amended) and requested the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (hereinafter, also referred to as “TRAI”, or “the Authority”) to provide recommendations for the auction of spectrum in the frequency bands identified for International Mobile Telecommunications (IMT). The afore -mentioned Reference dated 02.08.2023 is reproduced below: “In response to DoT's reference dated 13.09.2021, TRAI had provided its recommendations dated 11.04.2022 on various issues involved in the auction of spectrum in the 600 MHz, 700 MHz, 800 MHz, 900 MHz, 1800 MHz, 2100 MHz, 2300 MHz, 2500 MHz, 3300 MHz and 2 6 GHz bands. Based on the TRAI recommendations dated 11.04.2022 and its subsequent response dated 09.05.2022 on DoT's back -reference, Government conducted auction of spectrum in the above frequency bands during July-August, 2022. (i) A total of 72097.85 MHz spectrum in different band -LSA combinations worth Rs. 4,31,605 crores (at Reserve Price) were made available for bidding. A quantum of 51236.2 MHz worth Rs. 150173.3 crores were sold in the auction. However, no bids were received in the 600 MHz and 2300 MHz bands during the auction. As per the TRAI recommendations, a comprehensive report (Annexure-I) analysing the outcomes of the above auction was also communicated on 14.12.2022 to the TRAI. 2 2. Further, the following developments took place after the completion of the spectrum auctions held during July-August 2022: (i) Indian Railways surrendered 1.6 MHz of paired spectrum in the 900 MHz band in the Jammu & Kashmir LSA, which can be included in the next auction. (ii) Based on the recommendations of TRAI on Spectrum Requirements of National Capital Region Transport Corporation (NCRTC) for Train Control System for RRTS Corridors dated 28.12.2022, 5 MHz of paired spectrum has been assigned to NCRTC on provisional basis in the 700 MHz band. The same will be regularised after the final decision is taken on the above TRAI Recommendations. (iii) Recently, as per the decision taken by the Union Cabinet in its meeting held on 07.06.2023, the Department has reserved for BSNL's 5G purpose, 10 MHz (paired) spectrum in the 700 MHz band in all 22 LSAs in lieu of the 10 MHz (paired) spectrum previously reserved in the 600 MHz band, additional 30 MHz spectrum to the already reserved 40 MHz in the 3300 MHz band in all 22 LSAs, additional 400 MHz to the already reserved 400 MHz in the 26 GHz band in all but Kerala LSA. In Kerala LSA, 250 MHz in addition to already reserved 400 MHz in 26 GHz band is being kept reserved for 5G services of BSNL. (iv) Further, the Cabinet in its above meeting, has also decided to allot additional 20 MHz of spectrum in the Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kolkata, Tamil Nadu, Delhi and Mumbai LSAs and 10 MHz of spectrum in Gujarat and Maharashtra LSAs to BSNL in the 2500 MHz band for the roll out of 4G services, in addition to already reserved spectrum in various bands for them for 4G services through the Cabinet decision of 2019. These additional spectrum provisions for BSNL need to be kept out of the next auction. 3 2.1 In addition to above, Department of Telecommunications (DoT) has decided to make available the following new frequency bands as detailed below for IMT, which can be made available for bidding in the next auction. Sl. No Applications/ Services Frequency bands 1. IMT 37 - 37.5 GHz 2. IMT (to share with Satellite Gateway Earth Stations with suitable protection) 37.5 - 40 GHz, 42.5 - 43.5 GHz 2.2 The LSA-wise quantum available with the Government in the existing bands after the auction, taking into consideration the facts mentioned in the paras 2 (i) to (iv) and 2.1 above is given in Annexure-II. 2.3 Moreover, part of the administratively assigned spectrum to various TSPs, including that of BSNL, will be expiring during the year 2024; the same may also be included in the next auction. The LSA -wise details of such spectrum (2024 expiring) is placed at Annexure-III. 2.4 Further, as part of the reforms in the",

The LSA -wise details of such spectrum (2024 expiring) is placed at Annexure-III. 2.4 Further, as part of the reforms in the telecom sector, the Government has decided to hold spectrum auctions in the last quarter of every financial year. 3. Considering the above, the competent authority has decided that the spectrum mentioned at Para 2.2 and 2.3 above (Annexure-II and Annexure-III respectively) may be made available for bidding in the next auction for IMT. Any other spectrum, which might b e available due to any re -farming etc. in these bands before the start of the auction, will also be made part of the auction process. 4. In view of the above, under the terms of clause 11 (1)(a) of TRAI Act, 1997, as amended by TRAI Amendment Act 2000, TRAI is requested to: (a) provide recommendations on applicable reserve price, band plan, block size, quantum of spectrum to be auctioned and associated conditions for auction of spectrum in 600 MHz, 700 MHz, 800 MHz, 900 MHz, 1800 MHz, 2100 MHz, 2300 4 MHz, 2500 MHz, 3300 MHz, 26 GHz, 37 - 37.5 GHz, 37.5 - 40 GHz and 42.5 - 43.5 GHz bands for IMT. (b) provide any other recommendations deemed fit for the purpose of spectrum auction in these frequency bands, including the regulatory/ technical requirements as enunciated in the relevant provisions of the latest NFAP/Radio Regulations of the ITU.” B. TRAI’s Response Dated 01.09.2023 to the DoT’s Reference Dated 02.08.2023 1.2 Earlier, t he Authority in its recommendations on ‘Auction of Spectrum in frequency bands identified for IMT/5G’ dated 11.04.2022 1 (hereinafter, also referred to as “Re commendations dated 11.04.2022”), had recommended , inter-alia, as below: “6.42 As there will be regular conduct of spectrum auctions on annual basis (or at shorter intervals), the Authority recommends that (I) For existing bands (including for the bands being put to auction for the first time in the forthcoming auction), a fresh spectrum valuation exercise be conducted once every three years; a suitable reference be made to the Authority by Government for this purpose. (II) For auctions conducted in the interim period between periodic valuation exercises conducted once every three years, (1) for LSAs where the spectrum put to auction in a previous auction is sold, the auction determined prices (duly indexed using applicable MCLR if more than one year has elapsed since the previous auction) should be used for arriving at the reserve prices for the next auction; (2) for LSAs, where spectrum remains unsold in previous auctions, past recommended reserve price (without indexation) should be used. 1 https://trai.gov.in/sites/default/files/2024-09/Recommendations_11042022.pdf 5 (III) For new spectrum bands, to be put to auction for first time, a reference be sent to the Authority, as per established procedure as and when these bands are proposed to be put to auction. (IV) However, if required, DoT may seek fresh reserve prices from the Authority for the existing bands, providing a full and reasoned justification for the same.” 1.3 Subsequently, DoT, through a Back Reference dated 29.04.2022 , mentioned, inter-alia, as below: “DoT is of the view that given the fast-changing techno-commercial ecosystem, spectrum valuation at shorter intervals may be desirable. For instance, in LSAs/ bands where spectrum remains unsold, there could be a case for reduction in reserve prices. Alter natively, there could be a spectrum band which may become more valuable due to a technological breakthrough. Hence, it is proposed that recommendations of TRAI on spectrum pricing would be sought before conduct of every auction.” 1.4 With respect to the DoT’s Back Reference dated 29.04.2022, TRAI provided its response to DoT on 09.05.2022 and mentioned, inter-alia, as below: “DoT, in its letter dated 23.09.2021, inter alia, conveyed the Government’s decision regarding the regular conduct of spectrum auction on annual basis, normally in the last quarter of every financial year and at shorter intervals whenever necessary. The Au thority has, in this context, factored in this Government decision while making the recommendation at paragraph 6.42. The detailed rationale for this recommendation is given at paragraph",

As stated t herein, the Authority undertakes spectrum valuation exercises using various models/ approaches that use different datasets of technical, market and economic data, updated periodically. These parameters do not change much in a short time span. At the same time, the Authority had noted that there is a need to evaluate 6 the techno-economic context at regular intervals to reckon for changes. The Authority had also noted in this context that annual valuation exercises may not be necessary. As such, the Authority does not agree with DoT’s proposal to seek the Authority’s recommendations before conduct of every (annual/ shorter interval) auction, as this would not be necessary unless DoT comes to a conclusion that the changes in the techno-commercial ecosystem and other factors warrants a fresh valuation. The Authority reiterates its recommendation given at paragraph 6.42 of the Recommendations dated 11.04.2022. As recommended at sub - paragraph (IV) thereof, in case DoT would like to seek the Au thority’s recommendations for existing spectrum bands in the interim period between periodic valuation exercises conducted once every three years, it may do so with a full and reasoned justification for the same. For new spectrum bands to be put to auction for the first time, the recommendation at subparagraph (III) of paragraph 6.42 would be applicable.” 1.5 In view of the above, and in the absence of full and reasoned justification by DoT for seeking fresh reserve prices from the Authority for the existing bands, TRAI, through its response letter dated 01.09.2023 (Annexure 1.2 ) (hereinafter, also referred to as “Re sponse dated 01.09.2023”) to DoT , informed inter-alia, as below: “10. In light of the above, the Authority reiterates its recommendation at para 6.42 (II) of the Recommendations on ‘Auction of Spectrum in frequency bands identified for IMT/5G’ dated 11.04.2022 on the reserve price. All available spectrum in the existing bands viz. 600 MHz, 700 MHz , 800 MHz, 900 MHz, 1800 MHz, 2100 MHz, 2300 MHz, 2500 MHz, 3300 MHz, and 26 GHz in the referred LSAs may be put to auction with the same band plan, block size and associated conditions. 7 11. As per the para 6.42 (III) of the TRAI's Recommendations dated 11.04.2022, the Authority will initiate a consultation process for providing recommendations for the new referred bands viz. 37 -37.5 GHz, 37.5-40 GHz, and 42.5-43.5 GHz. 12. The Government may put to auction the spectrum in the existing bands viz. 600 MHz, 700 MHz, 800 MHz, 900 MHz, 1800 MHz, 2100 MHz, 2300 MHz, 2500 MHz, 3300 MHz, and 26 GHz without waiting for the Authority's recommendations for the new bands viz. 37-37.5 GHz, 37.5-40 GHz, and 42.5-43.5 GHz.” 1.6 Keeping in view the DoT’s Reference dated 02.08.2023, and the TRAI’s Response dated 01.09.2023, the Authority decided to initiate a consultation process for providing recommendations for the new referred bands viz. 37-37.5 GHz, 37.5-40 GHz, and 42.5-43.5 GHz bands. 1.7 Considering that the frequency range 40-42.5 GHz is not a part of the frequency ranges identified for IMT by DoT, TRAI through its letter dated 20.02.2024 requested DoT to inform as to whether the frequency range 40 -42.5 GHz has been identified for some other application(s) in India. In response, DoT, through its letter dated 13.03.2024, informed that the Government has decided the following apportionment/ sharing of the spectrum in the frequency range from 37-43.5 GHz between IMT and space based services: Sl. No. Application/ Service Frequency Bands 1. IMT 37-37.5 GHz 2. IMT and Satellite Gateway links 37.5-40 GHz 3. Satellite User/ Gateway links 40-42.5 GHz* 4. IMT and Satellite Gateway links 42.5-43.5 GHz * The frequency band 40.0-42.5 GHz (Space to Earth) is predominantly for satellite user links. However, this frequency band may also be used for Satellite Gateway links without causing any harmful interference to the satellite user links operating in these bands. 8 1.8",

However, there are two band plans, i.e., n259 (39.5-43.5 GHz) and n260 (37-40 GHz) in the frequency ranges referred by the DoT. Both the band plans defined by 3GPP viz. n259 and n260 for these frequency ranges are based on Time Division Duplexing (TDD) configuration. The frequency range 39.5-40 GHz is covered under both the band plans. 2.5 As far as the availability of device ecosystem for the referred frequency ranges is concerned, it is noted that the device ecosystem is available in the n260 band (37-40 GHz); however, it is not readily available in the n259 band (39.5 -43.5 GHz). Ofcom, UK mentioned in its consultation paper6 on ‘Enabling mmWave spectrum for new uses’ dated 09.05.2022 that the availability of mobile technology equipment and devices in the adjacent 39 GHz band 7, which has similar technical properties to the 40 GHz8 band, may facilitate the development of 40 GHz equipment for new uses. 2.6 From the study of international scenario regarding the adoption of the frequency ranges under consideration viz. 37-37.5 GHz, 37.5-40 GHz, and 42.5- 5 3GPP TS 38.101-2 V17.11.0 (2023-09) Source: https://portal.3gpp.org/desktopmodules/Specifications/SpecificationDetails.aspx?specificationId=3284 6 https://www.ofcom.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0027/237258/mmwave-spectrum-condoc.pdf 7 As per FCC, USA, 39 GHz band is from 38.6-40 GHz frequency range 8 As per Ofcom, UK, 40 GHz band is from 40.5-43.5 GHz frequency range 12 43.5 GHz, it was observed that in some of these frequency ranges, only Federal Communication Commission (FCC), USA auctioned spectrum; Innovation, Science and Economic Development (ISED), Canada has released a consultation paper, and O fcom, UK has issued a statement after due consultation process. 2.7 As per the GSA report9 on ‘mmWave Bands: Global Licensing and Usage for 5G’ of November 2020, “Band n260, covering 37 –40 GHz, is also used, with 32 companies in six countries/territories investing in licences for, or networks using this spectrum. Of those, 31 hold licences. (The majority of those are based in the USA and its territories.) Three operators in the USA have launched 5G using Band n260”. 2.8 In this background, the Authority solicited the comments of stakeholders on the following set of questions: Q1. Whether the entire available spectrum in each of the frequency ranges (a) 37-37.5 GHz, (b) 37.5 -40 GHz, and (c) 42.5 -43.5 GHz, should be put to auction for IMT? If no, please specify the quantum of spectrum in each frequency range to be put to auction. Kindly justify your response. Q2. In case you are of the opinion that any of the frequency ranges viz. 37 - 37.5 GHz, 37.5-40 GHz, and 42.5-43.5 GHz should be put to auction at a later date, what should be the timelines for auctioning of such frequency bands for IMT? Kindly justify your response. Q3. Do you agree that TDD-based duplexing configuration should be adopted in the country for the frequency ranges under consideration viz. (a) 37 - 37.5 GHz, (b) 37.5 - 40 GHz, and (c) 42.5 - 43.5 GHz, for IMT? If yes, considering that there is an overlap of frequencies in the band plans n260 9 https://gsacom.com/paper/mmwave-bands-global-licensing-and-usage-for-5g-2/ 13 (37-40 GHz) and n259 (39.5-43.5 GHz), how should the band plan(s) along with its frequency range be adopted? Kindly justify your response. Comments of stakeholders on Q1 and Q2 2.9 In response to Q1 and Q2, many stakeholders were of the view that the entire available frequency spectrum in each of the frequency ranges 37 -37.5 GHz, 37.5-40 GHz, and 42.5-43.5 GHz should be put to auction for IMT. On the other hand, many other stakeholders were in favour of putting the frequency",

On the other hand, many other stakeholders were in favour of putting the frequency spectrum bands in auction at a later date. 2.10 A broad summary of the comments of stakeholders, who are in favour of putting entire available frequency spectrum in each of the frequency ranges in forthcoming auction for IMT, is given below: (a) The availability of these new frequency ranges, in addition to the 26 GHz band, will enable the further expansion of 5G/ FWA services in the country and will also be instrumental in the deployment of enterprise use cases. (b) These bands have already been identified as the IMT bands , and hence their increased usability for telecom service providers (TSPs) will only help accelerate the ecosystem development. (c) A few of these stakeholders also submitted that a vailability of clean spectrum is crucial before auctioning. Hence, adequate information and necessary data regarding present/ planned locations of SRS/ satellite hub stations should be made available to TSPs, and a co -existence study between IMT and satell ite operations should be carried out prior to auctions. (d) One of the stakehol ders submitted that there are 7 -8 Radio Astronomy centers and proper radio isolation should be kept to ensure that interference effects between the systems is kept minimal. 14 2.11 A broad summary of the comments of stakeholders, who were not in favour of putting entire available frequency spectrum in each of the frequency ranges in forthcoming auction for IMT, is given below: (a) There is a huge challenge of device ecosystem for 37-37.5 GHz, 37.5-40 GHz, and 42.5-43.5 GHz. Device ecosystem is in nascent stage in (37-40 GHz) and is largely limited to US territories. In the 39.5-43.5 GHz, the device ecosystem is not readily available, both globally, as well as in India. (b) Without adequate device ecosystem there is no point in putting the entire range of spectrum for auctions as it will avail no benefit to the industry as such. (c) The auction of spectrum for these bands should be deferred by a few years (2-3 years), so that the device ecosystem develops in more global markets, providing more certainty of the device ecosystem in India, which can enable TSPs to project a viable business plan. One of the stakeholders also submitted that in case the Authority decides to put the proposed spectrum for auctions, then only range 37 -40 GHz with adequate protection for satellite services should be considered in the next round. The spectrum range 42.5 -43.5 GHz may be considered later after a gap of 3-4 years. 2.12 In addition, a couple of stakeholders suggested that from the frequency ranges under consideration, at least 250 MHz spectrum (FDD, paired) in the 37.5-40.0 GHz and 42.5 -43.5 GHz bands should be kept reserved specifically for microwave point -to-point applications such as a backhaul spectrum and its allocation should be done administratively on point-to-point basis. All licensed operators should be eligible to obtain, including access service providers. Comments of stakeholders on Q3 2.13 In response to the Q3, all stakeholders were unanimously in favour of adoption of TDD-based duplexing scheme for 37-37.5 GHz, 37.5-40 GHz, and 42.5-43.5 GHz frequency ranges. 15 2.14 A broad summary of the comments of stakeholders, in favour of TDD-based duplexing for 37-37.5 GHz, 37.5-40 GHz, and 42.5-43.5 GHz frequency ranges, is given below: (a) The TDD -based configuration has been globally adopted for mmWave band spectrum. Since the device ecosystem is developed at a global level, it is appropriate to follow international standards in this regard. (b) TDD can be more spectrum -efficient in certain deployment scenarios, particularly where traffic demands are less predictable. It offers the advantage of dynamically adjusting the ratio of uplink and downlink capacity based on traffic patterns, useful in sce narios where usage may be asymmetric. TDD may reduce infrastructure costs as a single frequency band can be used for both uplink and downlink. 2.15 There is an overlap of frequencies in the band plans",

The comments of stakeholders about the adoption of band plans in the frequency ranges from 37-37.5 GHz, 37.5-40 GHz, and 42.5- 43.5 GHz frequency range, may be summarized as below: (a) Most of the stakeholders were of the view that t he operators should be permitted to choose any band plan as per 3GPP, depending on the availability of the device ecosystem. However, a few stakeholders submitted that n260 band may be used for 37-40 GHz and n259 for 42.5- 43.5 GHz frequency range. (b) One of the stakeholders mentioned that each independent block of spectrum should be constrained completely within either band n259 or band n260 respectively. Analysis of the issues raised through the Q1 to Q3 2.16 In response to the Consultation Paper dated 04.04.2024, many stakeholders were of the view that entire available frequency spectrum in each of the frequency ranges viz. 37-37.5 GHz, 37.5-40 GHz, and 42.5-43.5 GHz be put to auction in the forthcoming auction; however, many other stakeholders were of 16 the view that due to lack of ecosystem, these frequency ranges should be put to auction after a period of 2-3 years. 2.17 In addition, a couple of stakeholders suggested that from the frequency ranges under consideration, at least 250 MHz spectrum (FDD, paired) in the 37.5-40.0 GHz and 42.5 -43.5 GHz bands should be kept reserved specifically for microwave point -to-point applications such as a backhaul spectrum and its allocation should be done administratively on point -to-point basis. In this regard, it is noted that the Government has already identified these frequency ranges for IMT. Further, other frequency bands are already available for backhaul purpose. 2.18 It is noteworthy that mmWave spectrum (26 GHz band) was put up for auction in India for the first time in the auction of frequency spectrum held in July - August 2022. In the auction, out of the total 3250 MHz spectrum available in each of the 22 LSAs, 400 M Hz was reserved for a public sector undertaking (PSU) operator in each of the 22 LSAs and the remaining spectrum was put to auction. Out of the overall 62,700 MHz (2,850 MHz in 22 LSAs) of spectrum put to auction, 45,350 MHz was sold and 17,350 MHz spectrum across 22 LSAs remained unsold in mmWave (26 GHz) band. 2.19 Subsequently, additional 400 MHz in each LSA except Kerala, and 250 MHz in Kerala LSA was reserved for the PSU operator. Rest of the unsold spectrum i.e. 8700 MHz of spectrum across 22 LSAs 10 was put to auction in the spectrum auction held in 2024 ; however, no bid was received . The table given below shows the LSA-wise spectrum availability in 26 GHz band: 10 https://dot.gov.in/sites/default/files/Notice%20Inviting%20Applications%202023-24.pdf 17 Table 2.2: LSA-wise spectrum availability in 26 GHz band LSA Total spectrum (in MHz) Reserved for PSU operator (in MHz) Spectrum sold in Auction (in MHz) Spectrum availability (in MHz) Andhra Pradesh 3,250 800 2,050 400 Assam 3,250 800 1,800 650 Bihar 3,250 800 1,800 650 Delhi 3,250 800 2,000 450 Gujarat 3,250 800 2,350 100 Haryana 3,250 800 2,200 250 Himachal Pradesh 3,250 800 1,800 650 Jammu & Kashmir 3,250 800 1,800 650 Karnataka 3,250 800 2,050 400 Kerala 3,250 650 2,600 - Kolkata 3,250 800 2,000 450 Madhya Pradesh 3,250 800 2,200 250 Maharashtra 3,250 800 2,200 250 Mumbai 3,250 800 2,100 350 North East 3,250 800 1,800 650 Odisha 3,250 800 1,800 650 Punjab 3,250 800 2,100 350 Rajasthan 3,250 800 2,150 300 Tamil Nadu 3,250 800 2,150 300 Uttar Pradesh (E) 3,250 800 2,050 400 Uttar Pradesh (W) 3,250 800 2,150 300 West Bengal 3,250 800 2,200 250 Total 71,500 17,450 45,350 8,700 2.20 As can be seen from the above table, while overall 8,700 MHz spectrum across 22 LSAs is available in mmWave (26 GHz) band; LSA-wise spectrum availability is not much and in",

Thus, to meet any future demand, there is a need for making available additional spectrum in other mmWave bands as referred by DoT through the instance reference dated 02.08.2023. 18 2.21 Based on the information available on the frequency check website 11, 263 devices of 11 brands supported the n260 band as of January 2025. Further, the charts depicting the number of operators investing in key 5G spectrum bands (end of October 2024) and the number of devices announced/ available at the end of October 2024, as published in the GSA report on 5G Market Snapshot (November 2024)12, are given below: Figure 2.1: Operators investing in key 5G spectrum bands (end of October -2024), Source: GSA13 11 FrequencyCheck - Mobile Network Compatibility Search for Unlocked Phones and Devices 12 5G Market Snapshot March 2024 released by GSA 13 GSA Report on 5G Market Snapshot, November 2024 (https://gsacom.com/paper/5g-market-snapshot- november-2024-2/) 19 Figure 2.2: Announced 5G device models supporting key 5G spectrum bands (end of October-2024), Source: GSA23 2.22 As can be seen from the above figure, device ecosystem is available in frequency band n260; however, for frequency band n259, the device ecosystem is yet to be developed. It is also noted that the device ecosystem in the n260 (37-40 GHz) band is better than that is available in the n258 (26 GHz) band. Therefore, the Authority is of the view that the frequency spectrum range 37 - 37.5 GHz and 37.5 -40 GHz should be put to auction in the forthcoming spectrum auction. 20 2.23 As regards 42.5 -43.5 GHz, it is noted that lately, f ully integrated, extended range mmWave antenna modules designed for 5G fixed wireless access customer premise equipment (CPE) are being launched by original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), which also includes 37-40 GHz14 and 39.5-43.5 GHz15 frequency range. It is also noted that Ofcom, UK is enabling mmWave spectrum (26 GHz and 40 GHz bands) for new services, including 5G16. Ofcom has stated that they plan to auction licences to use spectrum in the 25.1 -27.5 GHz and 40.5-43.5 GHz bands in certain parts of the country in 2025 17. With such developments, the device ecosystem in n259 band, which includes 42.5 - 43.5 GHz frequency range may begin to develop. However, it cannot be predicted with certainty about the time, by when the device ecosystem will be sufficiently available for the TSPs to derive economic value from the frequency spectrum in 42.5 -43.5 GHz. Further, putting this frequency range in the forthcoming auction along with band n260 with a combined spectrum cap, will increase the denominator and thereby the spectrum that can be acquired by a single bidder. This may create a situation where some of the bidders may monopolize the band n260, where device ecosystem is readily available. 2.24 In view of the foregoing discussion, the Authority is of the view that owing to non-availability of the device ecosystem in 42.5 -43.5 GHz frequency range, it will be prudent that the frequency range 42.5-43.5 GHz is not put to auction in the forthcoming sp ectrum auction. DoT may send a separate reference for seeking the Authority’s recommendations for 42.5 -43.5 GHz frequency range for IMT at an appropriate time. 2.25 It is noted that the higher frequency bands are generally used for enhancing capacity and lowering latency.

Further, 3GPP has defined this band only for TDD configuration-based band plans in mmWave spectrum bands. The stakeholders are also of the unanimous view that TDD -based configuration should be adopted for the frequency ranges referred to by DoT, viz. 37-37.5 GHz, 37.5- 40 GHz, and 42.5 -43.5 GHz.

Further, 3GPP has defined this band only for TDD configuration-based band plans in mmWave spectrum bands. The stakeholders are also of the unanimous view that TDD -based configuration should be adopted for the frequency ranges referred to by DoT, viz. 37-37.5 GHz, 37.5- 40 GHz, and 42.5 -43.5 GHz. Therefore, the Authority is of the view that TDD based configuration should be adopted for the frequency ranges 37-37.5 GHz and 37.5-40 GHz. 2.26 As mentioned above, the Authority is of the view that only 37-40 GHz frequency range should be put to auction in the forthcoming auction. Further, the device ecosystem is readily available in 37 -40 GHz, for which, 3GPP identified band plan n260 is available. Therefore, the Authority is of the view that for 37 -40 GHz frequency range, band plan n260 band should be adopted. 2.27 In view of the above, the Authority recommends that– (a) The frequency spectrum in 37 -37.5 GHz and 37.5-40 GHz frequency ranges should be put to auction in the forthcoming spectrum auction. (b) Band pan n260 with TDD-based duplexing configuration should be adopted for 37-40 GHz frequency range. (c) Owing to the non-availability of the device ecosystem in 42.5 - 43.5 GHz frequency range, it will be prudent that the frequency range 42.5-43.5 GHz is not put to auction in the forthcoming spectrum auction. DoT may send a separate reference for seeking the Authority’s recommendations for 42.5 -43.5 GHz frequency range for IMT at an appropriate time. 22 C. Validity Period and the License Service Area 2.28 As per the existing licensing and regulatory framework in India, access spectrum is assigned to access service licensees with a validity period of 20 years. 2.29 Considering that the new spectrum bands identified for IMT, particularly the higher spectrum bands , where ecosystem is not fully developed and such frequency bands are yet to find adequate use cases, there could be difficulty in assessing the true value of spectrum in such frequency bands. From the study of international scenario, it is observed that in some countries such as in USA, UK, and South Korea validity period of spectrum has been shortened for mmWave bands. 2.30 Further, considering mmWave spectrum is typically used for meeting the very high-capacity and ultra -low latency requirements, deployment of mmWave spectrum for IMT is not likely to be ubiquitous. From the international scenario, it is observed that some countries such as USA, UK, and Canada have considered a smaller licensed service area for mmWave bands. 2.31 In this background, the Authority solicited the comments of stakeholders on the following set of questions: Q4. Whether the spectrum in the frequency ranges under consideration viz. (a) 37 -37.5 GHz, (b) 37.5 -40 GHz, and (c) 42.5 -43.5 GHz should be assigned for a validity period of 20 years, as prevalent in the existing frequency bands, or for a shorter validity period? In case you are of the opinion that a shorter validity period should be adopted, please suggest the validity period? Kindly provide your response w ith detailed justifications. 23 Q5. Whether the spectrum in (a) 37-37.5 GHz, (b) 37.5-40 GHz, and (c) 42.5- 43.5 GHz frequency ranges should be assigned for the existing licensed service areas (LSAs) for Access Service (i.e. Telecom Circles/ Metros), or it should be assigned for smaller servi ce areas? In case you are of the opinion that the spectrum in these bands should be assigned for smaller service areas, please suggest the criteria for defining such service areas? Kindly provide your response with detailed justifications. Comments of stakeholders on Q4 2.32 In response to Q 4, most stakeholders were of the view that the spectrum in the frequency ranges under consideration viz. 37-37.5 GHz, 37.5-40 GHz, and 42.5-43.5 GHz for IMT should be assigned for a validity of 20 years, as prevalent in the existing frequency bands, while one of the stakeholders was in favour of shorter validity period. 2.33 A broad summary of the comments of stakeholders who were in favour of validity period of 20 years for assignment of spectrum in the frequency ranges under consideration, is given below: (a) For consistency with other spectrum licenses and clarity for telecom operators to roll-out",

(b) The spectrum validity should provide adequate time for ecosystem penetration, network planning and deployments , and substantial period for providing commercial services thus, enabling adequate certainty to a TSP’s business plans. (c) Longer validity periods have enabled technological development, with the same band being used for different technologies. Shorter validity periods would discourage such innovation and evolution due to the lack of certainty on recovery of investments. (d) Telecom is a capital intensive sector. Shorter validity periods may not provide sufficient time for TSPs to recoup their investments , and this would risk destabilising the long -term investments of the sector. It may 24 also attract fly -by-night operators, which may not be in the interests of either the consumers or the exchequer. (e) A few stakeholders opined that spectrum in these frequency ranges is unlikely to have eco -system fully developed from the beginning of allocation, therefore, these should be assigned for a period not less than 10-15 years or for 20 years. 2.34 A broad summary of the comments of stakeholders, who were in favour of shorter validity period than 20 years for assignment of spectrum in the frequency ranges under consideration, is given below: (a) These frequency bands are being considered for auction for the ﬁrst time, and for these higher spectrum bands ecosystem is not fully developed and are yet to ﬁnd adequate use cases ; therefore, assessing the true value of spectrum and their use-cases is not clear. (b) In the changing technological scenarios , and with the niche usage of mmWave spectrum the validity period of 10 or 15 years should suﬃce. Analysis of the issues raised through the Q4 2.35 As mentioned above, as per the extant licensing and regulatory framework, access spectrum is assigned to access service licensees with a validity period of 20 years. Further, based on the TRAI’s Recommendations dated 11.04.2022, the Government auctioned the spectrum in the mmWave band, that is, in the 26 GHz band for a period of 20 years. As already mentioned, the ecosystem in the frequency ranges under consideration has started developing, and internationally FCC has auctioned spectrum, and Ofcom, ISED, among others are planning to auction it, the ecosystem is expected to develop further. 2.36 The Authority examined the comments of the stakeholders. Most stakeholders were of the view that spectrum in the frequency ranges under consideration should be assigned for a validity of 20 years. The stakeholders in support mentioned that spectrum validity should provide adequate time for ecosystem 25 penetration, network planning and deployments, and substantial period for providing commercial services; telecom is capital intensive sector and shorter validity periods may not provide sufficient time to recoup investments; and longer validity periods enable technological development. The Authority concurs with the view of stakeholders. Therefore, the Authority is of the view that the frequency spectrum in the 37-40 GHz frequency range should be auctioned with a validity period of 20 years. 2.37 In view of the above, the Authority recommends that the frequency spectrum in the band n260 (37-40 GHz) should be auctioned with a validity period of 20 years. Comments of stakeholders on Q5 2.38 In response to the Q5, many stakeholders were in favour that the spectrum in the frequency ranges under consideration viz. 37-37.5 GHz, 37.5-40 GHz, and 42.5-43.5 GHz should be assigned for the existing licensed service areas (LSAs) for Access Service, while some stakeholders were in favour of smaller service areas. 2.39 A broad summary of the comments of stakeholders, who were in favour of existing licensed service areas (LSAs) for assignment of spectrum in the frequency ranges under consideration, is given below: (a) Assignment for smaller service areas may leave the rural and semi-urban areas uncovered, as TSPs would only be interested in getting the spectrum for densely populated urban areas.

(b) Smaller service areas would disrupt the entire network and business planning of TSPs and would create operational and regulatory complexities. It would be challenging for the Wireless Planning and Coordination (WPC) Wing of DoT to ensure interference management and harmonization with smaller service areas. 26 (c) Larger TSPs may not be able to deploy nation-wide or LSA-wide networks and enjoy economies of scale, due to disjointed spectrum holdings. (d) This is consistent with the approach followed in the case of the existing frequency bands, including 26 GHz band. 2.40 A broad summary of the comments of stakeholders, who were in favour of smaller service areas for assignment of spectrum under consideration, is given below: (a) The limited range of mmWave makes them suitable for a service area, much smaller to LSA based allocation prevalent as of now. (b) Smaller service areas would allow more flexible use of the spectrum and facilitate the shared use of the band between FSS and IMT. (c) Spectrum in mmWave should be assigned at Secondary Switching Areas/ SDCA or District level so that the eﬀective utilisation of the spectrum is achieved. Analysis of the issues raised through the Q5 2.41 It is noteworthy that the frequency spectrum is assigned on an existing licensed service area (LSA) basis, and based on the TRAI ’s Recommendations dated 11.04.2022, the Government auctioned the spectrum in the 26 GHz mmWave band on an existing LSA basis. Considering the validity period of such an assignment as 20 years, it allows reasonable time for the service provider to extend their services based on their business plan and business potential. 2.42 The Authority has examined the comments of the stakeholders. Most of the stakeholders were in favour of the assignment of spectrum for the existing LSAs (Telecom Circle/ Metro) , which will be consistent with the approach being followed for other spectrum bands including 26 GHz band. The stakeholders in support mentioned that assignment for smaller service areas may leave rural and semi-urban areas uncovered, as the service providers would be interested in getting spectrum for densely populated urban areas only. However, a few 27 other stakeholders suggested for smaller service areas such as secondary switching areas (SSA)/ short distance charging area (SDCA) or district level with a view that limited range of mmWave makes them suitable for a service area, much smaller to LSA based allocation prevalent as of now, which would allow more flexible use of the spectrum and facilitate shared use of the band between fixed satellite service (FSS) and IMT. In this regard, it is noted that the DoT has already earmarked the frequency ranges under consideration for IMT while permitting the establishment of satellite earth station gateways with suitable protection, which is deliberated in a subsequent section of this recommendation. 2.43 It is noteworthy that mmWave spectrum is likely to be used for the provision of use cases requiring very high data rates and ultra-low latency. Therefore, it is possible that the service providers may decide to deploy it selectively in the areas where the demand for such use cases exists. Further, with a longer validity period as recommended in the earlier section, if spectrum is assigned for the entire LSA (Telecom Circle/ Metro), as per the prevailing practice, it will allow the service providers to deploy the network according to the business plan. LSA -based spectrum assignments may nudge the service providers to utilize the spectrum in the maximum part of the LSA , including in remote and rural areas. It may also help in the development of new use cases. Therefore, the Authority is of the view that the frequency spectrum in the band n260 (37- 40 GHz) should be auctioned on LSA (Telecom Circle/ Metro) basis. 2.44 In view of the above, the Authority recommends that the frequency spectrum in the band n260 (37 -40 GHz) should be auctioned on LSA (Telecom Circle/ Metro) basis. 28 D.

Block size for the assignment of spectrum 2.45 Block size is the lowest unit of quantum of spectrum, in multiples of which, the spectrum is auctioned/ assigned. The bidders decide the number of blocks to bid in each spectrum band. In some cases, the minimum number of blocks that a bidder is required to bid is also prescribed. 2.46 The spectrum in 37-37.5 GHz, 37.5-40 GHz, and 42.5-43.5 GHz bands will be auctioned for the first time in India. As per the 3GPP18 standard, for n259 and n260 bands, the supported channel bandwidth is 50 MHz, 100 MHz, 200 MHz, and 400 MHz. From the study of international scenario, it has been observed that minimum block size of 100 MHz or 200 MHz have been adopted or is being considered. 2.47 In this background, the Authority solicits comments of stakeholders on the following question: Q6. What should be the block size, and the minimum quantity for bidding in (a) 37 -37.5 GHz, (b) 37.5 -40 GHz, and (c) 42.5 -43.5 GHz frequency ranges? Kindly justify your response. Comments of stakeholders on Q6 2.48 In response to the Q6 for the block size, most stakeholders were in favour of 100 MHz block size while a couple of stakeholders suggested 50 MHz block size in the frequency ranges under consideration viz. 37 -37.5 GHz, 37.5 -40 GHz, and 42.5-43.5 GHz. 18 ETSI TS 138 101-2 V17.11.0 (2023-10) URL: https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/138100_138199/13810102/17.11.00_60/ts_13810102v171100p.p df 29 2.49 The stakeholders who were in favour of 100 MHz block size mentioned that considering the adoption in developed countries and expected use cases, a 100 MHz block size should be optimal. This would meet the capacity requirement, utilisation efficiency, and propagation characteristics. While the stakeholders who were in favour of 50 MHz block size mentioned that a block size of 50 MHz would provide flexibility to telecom service providers to opt for quantum of spectrum required by them, and it will also be in line with the earlier followed practice in the allocation of mmWave band viz. 26 GHz band. 2.50 Regarding minimum quantity of bidding, a broad summary of the comments of stakeholders, is given below: (a) A few stakeholders were of the view that a minimum 400 MHz of spectrum will be required to provide optimum 5G services. (b) Some stakeholders were of the view that f or the existing operators, who already hold spectrum in any of the mmWave spectrum bands, the minimum quantity of bidding should be 100 MHz. For the new entrant, who are not holding any spectrum in the mmWave band, the minimum quantity for bidding should be 400 MHz. (c) One stakeholder submitted that a minimum bidding quantity should be 2 blocks of 100 MHz. (d) A few stakehdolers were of the view that the minimum quantity for bidding in should be one block of 100 MHz. This will provide ﬂexibility to the Government as well as the TSPs. Analysis of the issues raised through the Q6 2.51 While m any of the stakeholders suggested a block size of 100 MHz, a few suggested a block size of 50 MHz. 2.52 From the study of the international scenario, it has been observed that the USA conducted an auction in upper 37, 39 and 47 GHz bands for next generation wireless services and with a minimum block size of 100 MHz. Canada has issued 30 a consultation paper, wherein it has proposed to auction 38 GHz band with a block size of 100 MHz. Ofcom, UK in its statement and consultation on ‘Enabling mmWave spectrum for new uses -Auction design’ 19 dated 08.11.2023, has mentioned that it has decided to adopt a lot size of 200 MHz for 40 GHz band. 2.53 It is noteworthy that as per 3GPP , both frequency bands i.e., n259 and n260 bands support a channel bandwidth of 50 MHz, 100 MHz, 200 MHz and 400 MHz.

Considering the availability of spectrum in the frequency bands under consideration, the block size could be prescribed as any of the supported channel bandwidths. However, the Authority is of the view that it would be prudent to keep the block size of 100 MHz as it would give flexibility to the TSPs and may also encourage new entrants to participate in the auction. At the same time, considering that n260 frequency band is likely to be used for 5G services, TSPs may like to acquire larger chunk of spectrum in this band; therefore, in case a TSP acquires more than one block, the assignment of spectrum should be done in a contiguous manner. 2.54 In view of the above, the Authority recommends that the frequency band n260 (37-40 GHz) should be auctioned with a block size of 100 MHz, and the minimum number of blocks for bidding should be one. Further, DoT should ensure that in case a telecom service provider acquires more than one block, entire spectrum assigned to a telecom service provider is in a contiguous manner. E. Spectrum Cap for the Assignment of Spectrum 2.55 The spectrum cap is the limit of access spectrum a telecom operator can hold in a licensed service area . The objective of prescribing spectrum cap is to 19 https://www.ofcom.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0022/271129/consultation-statement-mmwave- auction-design.pdf 31 prevent large holdings of spectrum by one or a few service providers, which otherwise may create concerns for the competition in the market. 2.56 In the Notice Inviting Applications (NIA), 2024 dated 08.03.2024, the spectrum cap has been defined as below: “Spectrum Cap shall be as follows: a) A Cap of 40% on the combined spectrum holding in the sub-1 GHz bands i.e. 700 MHz, 800 MHz and 900 MHz bands, including existing spectrum holding of TSPs in these bands. b) A Cap of 40% on the combined spectrum holding in 1800 MHz, 2100 MHz, 2300 MHz and 2500 MHz bands, including existing spectrum holding of TSPs in these bands. c) A Cap of 40% on the spectrum holding in 3300 MHz band including existing spectrum holding of TSPs (rounded off considering the block size in this band). d) A Cap of 40% on the total spectrum holding in 26 GHz band including existing spectrum holding of TSPs (rounded off considering the block size in this band). … The following principles will be applied for the calculation of various spectrum caps for an LSA. a) All spectrum assigned to TSPs, including quantity of spectrum whose rights to use were put to auction but remained unsold, spectrum whose rights to use were assigned but subsequently surrendered by the TSPs or taken back by the licensor and quantity of spectrum whose rights to use are being put to auction would be counted for the purpose of the spectrum cap. b) The spectrum which may become available to DoT for commercial use after its refarming from other uses (such as defence) at different points of time would not be counted for determining the spectrum caps until its rights to use are put to auction. 32 c) In case a situation arises where due to any subsequent assignment of spectrum to defence/ non -commercial usage, spectrum cap is affected adversely, no TSP would be asked to surrender right to use of any spectrum which it already holds. d) For the sake of level playing field among Telecom Service Providers (TSPs), the same spectrum cap shall be made applicable for all the telecom service providers in that Licensed Service Area.” 2.57 As mentioned above, for the 26 GHz band spectrum, a band-specific spectrum cap of 40% was prescribed in the NIA 2024. The frequency spectrum in the frequency ranges under consideration viz. 37-37.5 GHz, 37.5-40 GHz, and 42.5- 43.5 GHz bands, will be auctioned for the first time in India. 2.58 In this background, the Authority solicit ed the views of stakeholders on the following question: Q7.

The frequency spectrum in the frequency ranges under consideration viz. 37-37.5 GHz, 37.5-40 GHz, and 42.5- 43.5 GHz bands, will be auctioned for the first time in India. 2.58 In this background, the Authority solicit ed the views of stakeholders on the following question: Q7. What provisions with respect to the spectrum cap per service provider in a licensed service area (LSA) should be made applicable for the frequency ranges under consideration viz. (i) 37-37.5 GHz, (ii) 37.5-40 GHz, and (iii) 42.5-43.5 GHz for IMT? Specifically, - (a) Whether there is a case for a combined spectrum cap for 26 GHz band (24.25-27.5 GHz) and the frequency ranges under consideration? If yes, what should be the spectrum cap? Kindly justify your response. (b) In case your response to (a) above is in the negative, whether spectrum cap should be prescribed separately for each frequency range viz. (i) 37 -37.5 GHz, (ii) 37.5 -40 GHz, and (iii) 42.5 -43.5 GHz, or these frequency ranges should be combined for applicabi lity of spectrum cap? What should be the spectrum cap(s)? Kindly justify your response. 33 Comments of stakeholders on Q7 2.59 In response to the Q7, a few stakeholders were in favour of a combined spectrum cap of 26 MHz and spectrum under consideration viz. 37-37.5 GHz, 37.5-40 GHz, and 42.5 -43.5 GHz, while a few stakeholders were in favour of separate spectrum cap for 26 GHz band and spectrum under consideration . One of the stakeholders was in favour of separate spectrum cap for each frequency range of spectrum under consideration viz. 37-37.5 GHz, 37.5 -40 GHz, and 42.5-43.5 GHz. 2.60 The stakeholders who were in favour of combined spectrum cap of 26 MHz and spectrum under consideration stated that the propagation characteristics of mmWave spectrum band is same for these frequency bands. In case, band wise cap needs to be put in place, then it would require revision in application of spectrum cap in sub-GHz bands and 1800/ 2100/ 2300/ 2500 MHz band s as well. 2.61 A broad summary of the comments of stakeholders, who were in favour of separate spectrum cap for 26 GHz band and spectrum under consideration, is given below: (a) The frequency ranges under consideration are not comparable with 26 GHz band in terms of ecosystem development. (b) A combined spectrum cap may lead to one TSP monopolizing the more developed 26 GHz band, while others are left with the newer bands which are still in the early stages of ecosystem development. 2.62 A broad summary of the comments of stakeholders, who were in favour of separate spectrum cap for each frequency ranges of spectrum under consideration viz. 37-37.5 GHz, 37.5-40 GHz, and 42.5 -43.5 GHz, was that in the combined spectrum cap, there could be a possibility of a service provider monopolizing one of the spectrum bands, particularly in the case of new 34 spectrum bands. Band -wise capping will ensure healthy competition and fair allocation of the natural resource. 2.63 In regard to the limit on spectrum cap for the frequency ranges under consideration, a broad summary of the comments of stakeholders, is given below: (a) Most of the stakeholders were in favour spectrum cap of 40%. (b) One of the stakeholders was of the view that a spectrum cap of 35% is most appropriate as it balances both the objectives of providing bidding activity as well as equitable availability of spectrum for all TSPs. (c) A few stakeholders were of the view that in case the current three-bidder scenario persists in the upcoming 5G auctions as well then keeping lower caps will lead to quasi-administrative allocation at reserve price. Therefore, no spectrum cap should be imposed, and in case it is deemed necessary, a spectrum cap of 50% for these bands may be prescribed to promote competition. 2.64 In addition, one stakeholder has suggested that since the public sector undertaking (PSU) operator does not participate in the spectrum actions, therefore, 25% of the spectrum to be put for auctions should be reserved for it to enable to meet the objectives as set by the Government.

Analysis of the issues raised through the Q7 2.65 It is noted that the frequency band n260 (37-40 GHz) will be put to auction for the first time. In case a combined spectrum cap for mmWave frequency bands i.e., 26 GHz band and 37-40 GHz frequency ranges, is prescribed, there could be a possibility that a service provider or a few service providers may monopolize one of the spectrum bands in which the ecosystem is more developed, thereby giving them a competitive edge. Therefore, the Authority is of the view that for the purpose of spectrum cap, a combined cap of all mmWave bands i.e. including 26 GHz band, may not be prudent. 35 2.66 Most of the stakeholders were in favour of a spectrum cap of 40% of the total spectrum put to auction . In case a spectrum cap of 35% is prescribed (as suggested by one of the stakeholders) and only the existing TSPs take part in the spectrum Auction, it may not result in a market clearing price for the spectrum. On the other hand, a spectrum cap of 50% (as suggested by a few stakeholders) may result in lessening of effective number of players in the market and competition post auction. Therefore, the Author ity is of the view that spectrum cap for the frequency band n260 (37-40 GHz) should be kept as 40% of the total spectrum put to auction. 2.67 In view of the above, the Authority recommends that spectrum cap for the frequency band n260 (37-40 GHz) should be kept as 40% of the total spectrum put to auction and it should not be clubbed with 26 GHz band for the purpose of spectrum cap. F. Rollout obligations for the Assigned Spectrum 2.68 Roll-out obligations are mandated for the spectrum assigned to the service providers to ensure that spectrum is used effectively and efficiently in a timely manner. 2.69 In the Recommendations dated 11.04.2022, the Authority had noted that mmWave spectrum is typically used for meeting the very high -capacity and ultra-low latency requirement. Deployment of mmWave spectrum for IMT is not likely to be ubiquitous as it is likely to be used for the creation of hotspots and provision of fixed wireless access (FWA) services. Therefore, prescribing band- specific coverage-based rollout obligations may not be appropriate. However, nominal network deployment -based rollout obligations may be specified to ensure that the spectrum purchased is put to an efficient use, in a timely manner. 36 2.70 In the NIA 202420 for the auction of spectrum, the following rollout obligations were defined for 26 GHz (24.25 - 27.5 GHz) frequency band: “8.3.2 For 26 GHz bands (a) In LSAs other than Metro LSAs The following rollout obligations for non-metro LSAs have to be fulfilled by the bidders acquiring spectrum through this auction: Time Period Roll Out Obligations (per LSA) Minimum number of towns to be covered using targeted sites (per LSA) Phase-1: By the end of 1st year Commercial launch of services anywhere in the LSA 1 Phase-2: By the end of 3rd Year Cumulative number of sites to be deployed: Category A LSAs: 240 Category B LSAs: 150 Category C LSAs: 80 In Category A LSAs: 2 In Category B LSAs: 1 In Category C LSAs: 1 Phase-3: By the end of 5th Year Cumulative number of sites to be deployed: Category A LSAs: 660 Category B LSAs: 460 Category C LSAs: 300 In Category A LSAs: 7 In Category B LSAs: 5 In Category C LSAs: 3 (b) Metro LSAs The following rollout obligations for metro LSAs have to be fulfilled by the bidders acquiring spectrum through this auction: Time Period Roll Out Obligations (per LSA) Phase-1: Commercial launch of services anywhere in the 20 NIA 2024: (https://dot.gov.in/sites/default/files/Notice%20Inviting%20Applications%202023- 24.pdf) 37 By the end of 1st year LSA Phase-2: By the end of 3rd Year Cumulative number of sites to be deployed in each LSA: 90 Phase-3: By the end of 5th Year Cumulative number of sites to",

What should be the roll-out obligations for the assignment of spectrum in (a) 37-37.5 GHz, (b) 37.5-40 GHz, and (c) 42.5-43.5 GHz frequency bands for IMT? Kindly justify your response. Comments of stakeholders on Q8 2.73 In response to the Q 8, most of the stakeholders were of the view that t here should be no separate roll -out obligations in respect of mentioned frequency ranges for such licensees who have already fulfilled roll -out obligations in 26 GHz band. However, o ne of the stakeholders opined that n ominal network deployment-based rollout obligations may be advised to ensure that the spectrum is put to efficient use, in a timely manner. 2.74 A broad summary of the comments of stakeholders is given below: (a) There should be no separate roll -out obligations for such licensees who have already fulfilled roll-out obligations in the 26 GHz band, as the new bands would be utilized only to build additional capacity over and above the network coverage already deployed using 26 GHz band. 38 (b) If an existing licensee has already met these obligations once using any technology in any band , the present approach of prescribing no rollout obligations should be continued. (c) Some stakeholders further submitted that for new entrants with no prior spectrum holding in any of the mmWave spectrum bands, rollout obligations should be similar to the roll -out obligations for 26 GHz spectrum in NIA 2022/ 2024 as the mmWave spectrum band (26 GHz band) are similar to spectrum bands under discussion. (d) One of the stakeholders suggested that c onsidering the evolving device eco-system in the bands, the Authority may consider giving some additional time to meet minimum roll-out obligations (MRO) to new TSPs proposing to have stand-alone networks in this band. Another stakeholder submitted that i f the Authority decides to specify any rollout obligation specific for these bands, like in the case of 24.25 -28.5 GHz, the time - period of the first phase should start once enough device ecosystem is achieved, say only after 5 years. Analysis of the issues raised through the Q8 2.75 The Authority has examined the comments of stakeholders. Most stakeholders were of the view that there should be no separate roll-out obligations for such licensees who have already fulfilled roll -out obligations in 26 GHz band. However, one of the stakeholders opined that n ominal network deployment - based rollout obligations may be advised to ensure that the spectrum is put to efficient use in a timely manner. 2.76 Based on the examination of the international scenario, the rollout obligations specified by USA, Canada and UK are given below: (a) USA 2.77 In 2020, FCC concluded auction (Auction 103), which offered 14,144 Upper Microwave Flexible Use Service licenses in the Upper 37 GHz (37.6 -38.6 GHz), 39 39 GHz (38.6 -40 GHz), and 47 GHz (47.2 -48.2 GHz) bands, and the licenses were based on Partial Economic Areas (PEAs). In this auction, construction requirements21 were prescribed as follows: Upper Microwave Flexible Use Service (UMFUS) licensees must make a buildout showing as part of their renewal applications. Licensees relying on mobile or point-to-multipoint service must show that they are providing reliable signal coverage and service to at least 40% of the population within the service area of the licensee, and that they are using facilities to provide service in that area either to customers or for internal use.

In this auction, construction requirements21 were prescribed as follows: Upper Microwave Flexible Use Service (UMFUS) licensees must make a buildout showing as part of their renewal applications. Licensees relying on mobile or point-to-multipoint service must show that they are providing reliable signal coverage and service to at least 40% of the population within the service area of the licensee, and that they are using facilities to provide service in that area either to customers or for internal use. Licensees relying on point -to-point service must demonstrate that they hav e four links operating and providing service, either to customers or for internal use, if the population within the license area is equal to or less than 268,000. If the population within the license area is greater than 268,000, a licensee relying on poi nt-to-point service must demonstrate that it has at least one link in operation and is providing service for each 67,000 population within the license area. In order to be eligible to be counted under the point -to-point buildout standard, a point -to-point link must operate with a transmit power greater than +43 dBm. In the alternative, a licensee may make its buildout showing on the basis of geographic area coverage. To satisfy the requirements of using this metric, licensees relying on mobile or point-to-multipoint service must show that they are providing reliable s ignal coverage and service to at least 25% of the geographic area of the license. The geographic area of the license shall be determined by the total land area of the county or counties covered by the license. Licensees relying on fixed point -to-point li nks or other, low -power point-to-point connections must show that they have deployed at least one transmitter or receiver in at least 25% of the census tracts within the license area. All equipment relied upon in the showing, whatever type of service or connection it provides, must be operational and providing service, either to customers or for internal use, as of the date of the filing. 21 Source:https://www.fcc.gov/auction/103 40 If a licensee in this service is also a Fixed -Satellite Service licensee and uses the spectrum covered under its UMFUS license in connection with a satellite earth station, it can demonstrate compliance with the requirements of this section by demonstratin g that the earth station in question is in service, operational, and using the spectrum associated with the license. This provision can only be used to demonstrate compliance for the county in which the earth station is located. Licensees may fulfill their performance requirement by showing that they meet their choice of any one of the above standards, or a combination thereof, but they may not combine population-based showings with geographic area-based showings. Showings that rely on a combination of multiple types of service will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Licensees must make their showing by the end of their initial license terms in these bands – there is no interim benchmark. Failure to meet this requirement will result in automatic cancellation of the license. In bands licensed on a Partial Economic Area basis, licensees will have the option of partitioning a license on a county basis in order to reduce the population within the license area to a level where the licensee’s buildout would meet one of the applicable performance metrics. (b) Canada 2.78 ISED, Canada22 in their consultation on a Policy and Licensing Framework for Spectrum in the 26, 28 and 38 GHz Bands, mentioned that the licensee would be required to demonstrate the spectrum use to actively offer service with number of stations in each Tier 5 service area as specified in annexure D23, at 22 Consultation on a Policy and Licensing Framework for Spectrum in the 26, 28 and 38 GHz Bands (https://ised-isde.canada.ca/site/spectrum-management-telecommunications/en/learn-more/key- documents/consultations/consultation-policy-and-licensing-framework-spectrum-26-28-and-38-ghz- bands) 23 Annex D: Proposed deployment requirements per Tier 5 service area (https://ised-isde.canada.ca/site/spectrum-management-telecommunications/en/learn-more/key- documents/consultations/consultation-policy-and-licensing-framework-spectrum-26-28-and-38-ghz- bands-annexes#tD1) 41 5 and 9.5 years following the initial licence issuance date.

Ofcom 24 https://www.ofcom.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0015/255030/03-23-statement-and-consultation- mmwave.pdf 42 viewed that spectrum hoarding, and other spectrum allocation inefficiencies, can be resolved without the need for ‘use it or lose it’ conditions. After stakeholders’ consultation, Ofcom, in its statement of September 2023 on ‘Enabling mmWave spectrum for new uses’ 25, decided not to include any roll - out obligations in the award licences . Ofcom stated that “spectrum hoarding, and other spectrum allocation inefficiencies, can be resolved without the need for ‘use it or lose it’ conditions. These include that: a) it will be possible to trade award licences to a third party; b) if spectrum remains unused and there are no immediate plans to use it in certain areas, if there is demand, we are able to issue licences under our Local Access licensing framework; and c) as set out in Section 6, we have decided to award fixed term licences with a 15 year.” 2.80 From the above, it may be seen that FCC in the USA has prescribed coverage- based rollout requirements for the spectrum license in Upper 37 GHz Band (37.6-38.6 GHz) and 39 GHz Band (38.6-40 GHz), and ISED in the Canada has proposed network deployment requirements in terms of minimum number of stations to be deployed in each service area in the 38 GHz band. On the other hand, Ofcom in the UK has decided not to include any roll -out obligations in the award license for spectrum in 40 GHz band. 2.81 It is noted that the mmWave spectrum is typically used for meeting the high- capacity and ultra-low latency requirement, and its deployment is not likely to be ubiquitous ; therefore, coverage -based roll out obligations may not be appropriate. However, the Authority is of the opinion that there should be some network deployment -based rollout obligations to ensure that spectrum assigned to an entity is put to use at the earliest. 25 https://www.ofcom.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0033/268656/Statement-Enabling-mmWave- spectrum-for-new-uses.pdf 43 2.82 It is noted that many stakeholders suggested that there should be no separate roll-out obligations for such licensees who have already fulfilled roll -out obligations in the 26 GHz band and the present approach of prescribing no rollout obligations if an existing licensee has already met these obligations once using any technology in any band , should be continued . In this regard, it is noted that the NIA for auction of spectrum includes a clause that ‘t he requirement of rollout obligation shall be treated as fulfilled once the required numbers of DHQs/BHQs/Rural SDCAs are covered by the licensees using any technology in any band ’. It is also noted that similar clause was not made applicable for 3.5 GHz band and 26 GHz band, wherein the roll out obligations were not coverage -based but network deployment -based.

Thus, the minimum roll-out obligations should be equally applicable for all the TSPs i.e., existing as well as the new TSPs. 2.83 With respect to enhancing the timeline for the fulfilment of minimum roll out obligations, as suggested by a few stakeholders, the Authority is of the view that the stakeholders decide to acquire spectrum in a frequency band only after considering several factors including the availability of ecosystem. Further, enhancement of time period for fulfilment of minimum roll out obligations to 5 years or so may increase the likelihood of hoarding of spectrum. 2.84 In view of the above, in order to ensure that the spectrum is put to use at the earliest and to prevent hoarding, it would be prudent to have some network deployment-based minimum rollout obligations, irrespective of whether the entity is holding spectrum in the other mmWave band such as 26 GHz band. Therefore, the Authority is of the view that minimum rollout obligations for n260 (37-40 GHz) band should be similar to that prescribed for 26 GHz band in the NIA 2024. 44 2.85 In view of the above, the Authority recommends that (a) The minimum roll-out obligations for band n260 ( 37-40 GHz) should be similar to that prescribed for 26 GHz band in the NIA, 2024. (b) The minimum roll-out obligations should be equally applicable for all the TSPs i.e., existing as well as the new TSPs. G. Eligibility Conditions and Associated Conditions for Participation in the Auction 2.86 Eligibility conditions for the participation in the auction are specified in the relevant NIA. The eligibility conditions prescribed in the NIA 2024 26, are reproduced below: “3.1 Eligibility criteria to participate in the Auction (i) Any licensee that holds a UASL/ UL with authorization for Access Services for that LSA; or (ii) Any licensee that fulfils the eligibility criteria for obtaining a Unified License with authorization for Access Services, and gives an undertaking to obtain a Unified License with authorization for Access Services and an undertaking regarding compliance to FDI guidelines; or (iii) Any entity that gives an undertaking to obtain a Unified License with authorization for Access Services through a New Entrant Nominee as per the DoT guidelines/ license conditions, and an undertaking regarding compliance to FDI guidelines, can bid for the Spectrum in 800 MHz, 900 MHz, 1800 MHz, 2100 MHz, 2300 MHz, 2500 MHz, 3300 MHz, and 26 GHz Bands subject to other provisions of the Notice. A Unified License can only be awarded to an Indian Company. Hence, any foreign applicants will need to form or acquire an Indian company, to obtain a Unified License. However, they are allowed to participate in the auctions directly 26 https://dot.gov.in/sites/default/files/Notice%20Inviting%20Applications%202023-24.pdf 45 and apply for a Unified License subsequently through an Indian company, where they hold equity stake, with a maximum foreign equity up to 100% under Automatic route subject to restrictions on investments from land border sharing countries as per extant guidelines. …” 2.87 The associated eligibility conditions prescribed in the NIA 202 4 stipulate ‘Net Worth’ requirements on bidders. The key requirement is reproduced below: “A Bidder is required to show a net worth of Rs.100 Crore per License Service Area (Rs. 50 Crore each for Jammu & Kashmir and North East Service Areas), in which the bidder wants to submit bids. The net worth requirement is applicable in case of ‘New Entran ts’ and the same is not applicable in case of existing licensees. However, this condition of net worth requirement will be applicable on new entrants only in those LSAs where they do not hold any spectrum in any of the bands (i.e., any of the 700/800/900/1800/2100/2300/2500/3300 MHz & 26 GHz bands).” 2.88 In this context, the Authority solicited views of stakeholders on the following question: Q9.

Whether the eligibility conditions and associated eligibility conditions for participation in the auction for 37 -37.5 GHz, 37.5-40 GHz, and 42.5-43.5 GHz should be kept analogous to the eligibility conditions and associated eligibility conditions for participation in the auction for spectrum for IMT, as defined in NIA 2024? In case your response is in the negative, suggestions may kindly be made with detailed justification. Comments of stakeholders on Q9 2.89 In response to the Q9, most stakeholders were in favour of no change in current eligibility conditions and associated eligibility conditions for the spectrum under consideration viz. 37-37.5 GHz, 37.5-40 GHz, and 42.5-43.5 GHz, while a few 46 stakeholders were in favour of certain changes in current eligibility conditions and associated eligibility conditions for the spectrum under consideration. 2.90 The stakeholders who were in favour of no change in current eligibility conditions and associated eligibility conditions for the spectrum under consideration, submitted that the eligibility conditions and associated eligibility conditions for participation in these bands should be kept analogous to NIA 2024. 2.91 The stakeholders who were in favour of a change in current eligibility conditions and associated eligibility conditions for the spectrum under consideration , submitted that the eligibility criteria for the allocation of these bands should include TSPs other than Access Service providers including ISPs. It can serve the purpose of provision of high -capacity point-to-point links for Enterprise customers. The revision will promote the usage/ adoption of these frequency ranges and boost the development of enterprise-based use cases. Analysis of the issues raised through the Q9 2.92 Most of the stakeholders were of the view that the current eligibility conditions and associated eligibility conditions for auction of access spectrum should be made applicable for the frequency bands under consideration, while a few stakeholders were of the view that the eligibility criteria for the assignment of these bands should include TSPs other than Access Service Providers including Internet Service Providers (ISPs). 2.93 The issue of allowing ISPs to participate in the spectrum auction was examined by the Authority in the Recommendations on ‘Auction of Spectrum in frequency bands identified for IMT/5G’ dated 11.04.2022 and viewed that ISPs should not be allowed to participate in the access spectrum auction, which was accepted by the Government. In the said recommendations dated 11.04.2022 , the Authority noted, inter-alia, as below: 47 “2.210 … in the year 2010, for the spectrum in 2300 MHz band was auctioned first time and ISP Category A licensees were permitted to bid and use it under ISP license. The spectrum was designated as Broadband Wireless Access (BWA) spectrum. For all other access spec trum bands, ISPs were not eligible to take part in spectrum auction under ISP license. 2.211 After 2010, spectrum in 2300 MHz band came up for auction in 2016. On the basis of TRAI’s recommendations, during this auction UASL/ CMTS/ UL(AS)/ UL with authorization for Access Services were eligible to participate and ISP licensees were not made part of it. While giving its recommendations in 2016, the following rationale was given for not making ISPs eligible for bidding for spectrum: “Uniform eligibility criteria should be made applicable for all the access spectrum bands. Earlier, it was envisaged that the spectrum in the 2300 MHz bands would be used for wireless broadband services. Over a period of time, the technology and the device ecosystem has evolved and now same technology which is used in other bands can also be used in 2300 MHz band and 2500 MHz band. Therefore, as far as eligibility conditions to participate in an auction is concerned, there is no justification for separate treatment to 2300 MHz and 2500 MHz bands vis -à-vis other access spectrum bands.” 2.212 It may be mentioned that none of the ISPs who acquired 2300 MHz spectrum in the auction held in the year 2010, used such spectrum as an ISP – most of them were acquired by",

In case ISPs are permitted to bid for access spectrum, the spectrum can be utilized only for t he services permitted under ISP authorization; therefore, it will lead to inefficient utilization of spectrum. 48 Further, the cost of Access service authorization does not appear to be a hindrance as it may be miniscule in comparison to the cost of deployment of network and cost of spectrum. After the telecom reforms announced in September 2021 by the Government, relaxation has been granted in respect of bank guarantees for the operator, Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR) has been rationalized by permitting exclusion of non-telecom revenue, KYC reforms have been made. So, it is easier for an ISP to migrate to/or acquire Access Services authorisation to provide all array of services to the customers. 2.214 TRAI in its recommendations on ‘Enabling Unbundling of Different Layers Through Differential Licensing’ of August 2021, had recommended to create a new category of license for Access Network Provider under UL. It was also recommended that like Unified Licensee with access service authorization, the Access Network provider be permitted to acquire spectrum through spectrum auctions, subjected to the prescribed spectrum caps, enter into spectrum trading and spectrum sharing arrangement with the other Ac cess Network providers and unified licensees with Access service authorization. If DoT accepts TRAI recommendations on Unbundling of Licensing layers, ISPs will also have an option to take ‘Network Service Provider’ authorisation or become VNO of a Network provider for delivery of services.” 2.94 The above -mentioned TRAI recommendation on ‘Enabling Unbundling of Different Layers Through Differential Licensing’ of August 2021 was not accepted by the Government. 2.95 It is also noted that the Authority has recently given recommendations on the ‘Framework for Service Authorisations to be Granted Under the Telecommunications Act, 2023’ dated 18.09.202427 to the Government on the terms and conditions, including fees or charges, under the provisions of the Telecommunications Act, 2023. The recommendations have further enhanced, 27 https://www.trai.gov.in/sites/default/files/2024-11/Recommendation_18092024.pdf 49 inter-alia, the scope of the ‘Access Service Authorisation’ and ‘Internet Service Authorisation’ and with reduced entry barriers. 2.96 According to the ITU 28 about the IMT , “[t]he term International Mobile Telecommunications (IMT) is the generic term used by the ITU community to designate broadband mobile systems. It encompasses IMT -2000, IMT - Advanced, IMT- 2020 and IMT-2030 collectively, respectively called 3G, 4G, 5G and 6G by the market”. The term IMT is defined in Resolution ITU-R 5629, and the term “IMT -2000” encompasses also its enhancements and future developments. 2.97 It is also noted that in the ITU Recommendation30 (ITU-R M.687-2), IMT-2000 aim to achieve, inter-alia, the following primary general objectives: “1.1.1 to make available to users who are on the move or whose location may change (mobile users), irrespective of their location (i.e. national and international roaming), a wide range of telecommunication services (voice and non-voice), allowing communi cation between mobile users and other mobile users, users of the fixed public networks (PSTN, PDNs and ISDN) or other telecommunication networks as appropriate; 1.1.5 to provide for the continuing flexible extension of service provision, subject to the constraints of radio transmission, spectrum efficiency and system economics; 1.1.7 to permit the use of the IMT -2000 for the purpose of providing its services to fixed users, under conditions approved by the appropriate national or regional authority, either permanently or temporarily, either in rural or urban areas; … IMT-2000 aim to achieve the following primary technical objectives: 28 https://www.itu.int/en/itu-r/documents/itu-r-faq-imt.pdf 29 https://www.itu.int/dms_pub/itu-r/opb/res/R-RES-R.56-3-2023-PDF-E.pdf 30 https://www.itu.int/dms_pubrec/itu-r/rec/m/R-REC-M.687-2-199702-I!!PDF-E.pdf 50 1.2.4 to provide service flexibility which permits the optional integration of services such as mobile telephone, dispatch, paging and data communication, or any combination thereof; 1.2.5 to support terminal",

Figure 2.3: Capabilities of IMT-2000 and systems beyond IMT-2000 31 https://www.itu.int/dms_pub/itu-r/opb/res/R-RES-R.56-2007-PDF-E.pdf 51 2.99 As can be seen from the figure 2.3 above, IMT systems include new nomadic/ local wireless access. The ITU Recommendation (ITU-R M.164532) mentions that the “[t]he enhanced IMT -2000 and the new mobile access of systems beyond IMT-2000 will be part of the cellular layer and hot spot layer. Nomadic/ local wireless access of systems beyond IMT -2000 will be part of the hot spot layer”. 2.100 The ITU Recommendation 33 (ITU-R F.1399), defines ‘fixed wireless access (FWA)’ as “[w]ireless access application in which the location of the end -user termination and the network access point to be connected to the end-user are fixed.” and ‘nomadic wireless access (NMA)’ as “[w]ireless access application in which the location of the end-user termination may be in different places but it must be stationary while in use”. 2.101 It is noteworthy that the mmWave frequency spectrum, including 37-40 GHz frequency range, are typically used for applications requiring very high-capacity and ultra-low latency, and deployment of such mmWave spectrum for IMT is not likely to be ubiquitous. The prime use case that is likely to be deployed in these bands is Fixed Wireless Access (FWA) i.e., broadband internet connections. Provisioning of internet connections can also be done under Internet Service Provider (ISP) authorisation. The Authority is of the view that allowing ISPs to participate in the spectrum auction for band n260 (37-40 GHz) could accelerate broadband penetration across the country. It will also help in increasing competition and choice for the consumers. Further, overall 3 GHz spectrum is available in the n260 band. Allowing ISPs to participate in spectrum auctions for these bands does not appear to cause scarcity of spectrum for access service providers. 32 ITU-R M.687 -2: Framework and overall objectives of the future development of IMT -2000 and systems beyond IMT-2000 (Source: https://www.itu.int/dms_pubrec/itu-r/rec/m/r-rec-m.1645-0-200306-i!!pdf-e.pdf) 33 ITU-R F.1399: Vocabulary of terms for wireless access (Source: https://www.itu.int/dms_pubrec/itu-r/rec/f/R-REC-F.1399-1-200105-I!!PDF-E.pdf) 52 2.102 Therefore, the Authority is of the view that along with the telecom service providers holdin g the access service authorisation, internet service authorisation holders should also be permitted to participate in the auction of frequency spectrum for band n260 (37-40 GHz). Considering that the spectrum is auctioned on LSA (Telecom Circle/ Metro areas) basis, internet service authorisation holders of category ‘A’ and category ‘B’ should be permitted to participate in the auction of frequency spectrum for band n260 (37-40 GHz). 2.103 Further, the Authority in its earlier recommendations on “ Spectrum, Roaming and QoS related requirements in Machine-to-Machine (M2M) Communications\" dated 05.09.201734, recommended, inter-alia, that – “Connectivity provider using LPWAN technologies operating in unlicensed spectrum should be covered under licensing through a new authorization under UL namely UL (M2M). Such licensees should be allowed to bid for licensed spectrum to provide exclusively M2M services, if they desire to provide M2M services in the licensed band.” 2.104 Subsequently, a new service authorisation for “ Machine to Machine Service (M2M)” was introduced under the Unified License by the DoT, wherein it was mentioned, inter-alia, that – “2(iii) The Licensee intending to provide services exclusively through the LPWAN or equivalent technologies using unlicensed spectrum shall be covered under this authorization. Such licensees may also obtain licensed spectrum to provide M2M services exclusively, if they desire to provide M2M services in the licensed band.” 2.105 In the recently given recommendations by the Authority on the ‘Framework for Service Authorisations to be Granted Under the Telecommunications Act, 2023’ dated 18.09.202435 to the Government on the terms and conditions, including fees or charges, under the provisions of the Telecommunications Act, 2023, the 34",

The terms and conditions recommended for the service authorisation include as given below: “4. Assignment and use of spectrum: The Authorisation does not confer any right to assignment and use of spectrum, for which separate specific frequency assignment shall be required from the Central Government under Section 4 of the Telecommunications Act, 2023. In case the Authorised Entity obtains spectrum from the Central Government, the terms of conditions of the assignment of spectrum and the provisions of the relevant Notice Inviting Application (NIA) document for the auction of spectrum, if spectrum is obtained through auction, shall a lso be applicable on the Authorised Entity along with the Service Authorisation.” 2.106 In view of the above, as already recommended by the Authority through its earlier recommendations dated 05.09.2017, the entities with authorisation for M2M service category A/ B under the Unified License, or M2M WAN Service Authorisation with service area as national (category -A) or Telecom circle/ Metro Area (Category-B), as recommended by the Authority through Recommendations dated 18.09.2024, should also be allowed to participate in the spectrum auction for frequency band n260 (37-40 GHz). 2.107 While allowing Internet Service authorisation holders and M2M WAN service authorisation holders for category ‘A’ and category ‘B’ service area to participate in the spectrum auction for frequency band n260 , the relevant obligatory provisions on access service providers holding ‘access spectrum ’ such as presumptive AGR, and restrictions on equity crossholding shall become applicable on the successful bidders with Internet Service Authorisation or M2M WAN Service Authorisation. However, relevant security rela ted provisions etc. will require to be specifically made applicable on the successful bidders with Internet Service Authorisation or M2M WAN Service Authorisation . The Authority is of the view that the relevant security related provisions should be 54 included in the Internet Service Authorisation and M2M WAN Service Authorisation which should become applicable if such authorisation holders acquire access spectrum. 2.108 With regard to spectrum sharing, trading, and leasing, the provisions that need to be made applicable for ISPs or M2M WAN service providers, require detailed examination and consultation with stakeholders. Therefore, the Authority is of the view that in case DoT agrees with the Authority’s recommendation to permit such entities to participate in the spectrum auction for the frequency band n260 (37 - 40 GHz), it may go ahead with the spectrum auction, and if required, it may subsequently send a separate reference to the Authority with respect to sharing, trading and leasing of spectrum among such entities . However, the existing provisions for the surrender of access spectrum should be extended to all successful bidders , including Internet service providers and M2M WAN service providers. 2.109 In view of the above, the Authority recommends that - (a) In addition to the entities holding the access service authorisation, the following entities should also be permitted to participate in the auction of spectrum for frequency band n260 (37-40 GHz): (i) The entities holding Internet service authorisation for Category ‘A’ and Category ‘B’ service area (ii) The entities holding authorisation for M2M service category A/ B under the Unified License, or M2M WAN Service Authorisation with service area as national (Category-A) or Telecom circle/ Metro Area (Category-B), as recommended by the Authority through Recommendations dated 18.09.2024. (b) The successful bidders will be permitted to use the acquired spectrum to offer service as per the scope of their respective service authorisations. 55 (c) The relevant security related provisions should be included in the Internet Service Authorisation and M2M WAN Service Authorisation which should become applicable if such authorisation holders acquire access spectrum.

H. Interference Mitigation in the TDD Duplexing Bands 2.110 The Authority solicited the views of stakeholders on the following question: Q10. To mitigate inter -operator interference due to TDD -based configuration, whether the approach adopted for 3300 -3670 MHz and 26 GHz bands should also be made applicable for the frequency ranges under consideration viz. 37-37.5 GHz, 37.5-40 GHz, and 42.5-43.5 GHz, or some other provisions need to be created? In case you are of the opinion that some other provisions are required to be created, suggestions may be made with detailed justification. 56 Comments of stakeholders on Q10 2.111 In response to the Q 10, to mitigate inter -operator interference due to TDD - based configuration for the frequency ranges under consideration , the stakeholders were unanimously in favour that the approach adopted for 3300- 3670 MHz and 26 GHz bands should also be made applicable. Analysis of the issues raised through Q10 2.112 When more than one Time Division Multiplexing (TDD) network operates in the same band and in the same geographical area, interference may occur if the networks are uncoordinated i.e., if some base stations (BSs) are transmitting while others are receiving. A synchronized operation of TDD networks prevents simultaneous uplink and downlink. 2.113 In the Recommendations dated 11.04.2022, the Authority examined this issue with respect to 3300-3670 GHz and 26 GHz bands and noted, as below: “2.232 Further, to cater to the different 5G use cases, the TSPs may like to implement Dynamic TDD, wherein each cell in the network can adapt its uplink- downlink ratio depending on the traffic requirement. Prescribing a frame structure with a downlink and uplink configuration could come in way of implementation of dynamic TDD. 2.233 However, in case of multiple service providers environment and spectrum is assigned on LSA basis, possibility of interference on border areas cannot be ruled out. Therefore, there may be a need to synchronize outdoor networks or adjacent frequencies of different TSPs. 2.234 Considering the global trend, 3300 -3670 MHz and 24.25 -28.5 GHz bands are likely to be used for 5G deployment, and TSPs may like to acquire larger chunk of spectrum in each of these bands. As already recommended that 57 in case a TSP acquires more than one block, the entire spectrum should be assigned in a contiguous manner. Thus, contiguous spectrum assignment will reduce the chances of interference to a large extent. Further, since spectrum is assigned on LSA basis, cross border interference issues could still be there if the overlapping frequency spots have been assigned to different TSPs in neighboring LSAs.

The Authority concurs with the views of stakeholders. 2.115 In view of the above, the Authority recommends that to mitigate inter- operator interference in 37-40 GHz band with TDD configuration, the following measures should be taken – (a) In case a TSP acquires more than one block, the entire spectrum should be assigned to it in a contiguous manner. 58 (b) In case a TSP acquires spectrum in more than one LSA, same frequency spots should be assigned to it in all those LSAs, to the extent possible. (c) Interference mitigation should be left to the mutual coordination between the TSPs. I. Coexistence of IMT and Satellite Earth Station Gateways 2.116 As per the DoT’s Reference dated 02.08.2023, 37-37.5 GHz, 37.5-40 GHz, and 42.5-43.5 GHz bands have been identified for IMT; however, 37.5-40 GHz and 42.5-43.5 GHz frequency bands will also be shared with satellite gateway Earth Stations with suitable protection. 2.117 In terrestrial networks, the deployment of mmWave networks is primarily intended to address the growing demand for capacity across different geographic areas. Due to significant propagation loss, achieving seamless coverage poses a challenge, however, it provides an opportunity for sharing of the same spectrum with the satellite gateway earth stations. 2.118 According to the National Frequency Allocation Plan (NFAP) 2022 issued by DoT, apart from mobile service, the frequency range from 37.5 to 40 GHz has been allocated for FSS (Space to Earth) and frequency range from 42.5 to 43.5 GHz has been allocated for FSS (Earth to Space). 2.119 It may be noted that for the spectrum in 27.5-28.5 GHz frequency range, TRAI in its Recommendations dated 11.04.2022, had recommended, inter-alia, as below: a) As mmWave spectrum is going to be used for capacity requirement, its deployment is not likely to be ubiquitous rather it is more likely to be kind of hotspots or urban micro cells. Therefore, IMT Stations and Satellite Earth Stations Gateway (Earth to Space) can co-exist in 27.5-28.5 GHz frequency 59 range. The Satellite Earth Station Gateway should be permitted to be established in frequency range 27.5 -28.5 GHz at uninhabited or remote locations on case -to-case basis, where there is less likelihood of 5G IMT services to come up. b) DoT should prescribe the exclusion zone requirement for co -existence of IMT and satellite earth stations (Earth to space) in 27.5-28.5 GHz frequency range. c) DoT should create a software defined automated process on a portal having database of coordinates of the IMT base stations in mmWave. The geofencing coordinates of the proposed earth station in 27.5-28.5 GHz can provide the feasibility results through the portal for establishing the earth station. d) Spectrum dues for 27.5 -28.5 GHz frequency range can be revised on pro - rata basis for the mobile operator holding spectrum in the LSA, in which the permission for establishing earth station is given in the same frequency range, on account of creation of exclusion zone. 2.120 In this context, the Authority solicited the views of stakeholders on the following question: Q11. Whether there could be any challenges in sharing of 37.5 -40 GHz and 42.5-43.5 GHz spectrum frequency ranges between IMT and Satellite Gateway links? If yes, what challenges do you foresee and what measures could be adopted to mitigate such challenges? Kindly justify your response. Q12. In case it is decided to share (i) 37.5 -40 GHz, and (ii) 42.5 -43.5 GHz spectrum frequency ranges between IMT and Satellite Gateway links, - (i) Whether there is a need to prescribe a protection/ keep-off distance between IMT stations and Satellite Earth Station Gateways?

Suggestions may kindly be made with detailed justification. 60 Comments of stakeholders on Q11 and Q12 2.121 In response to the Q11 and Q12, most stakeholders were of the view that there is no challenge in sharing of 37.5 -40 GHz and 42.5 -43.5 GHz spectrum frequency ranges between IMT and Satellite Gateway links. However, a few stakeholders mentioned that there are challenges in the coexistence in sharing of 37.5-40 GHz and 42.5 -43.5 GHz spectrum frequency ranges between IMT and Satellite Gateway links, and some measures are to be taken for their coexistence. 2.122 A broad summary of the comments of stakeholders, who are of the view that there is no challenge in sharing of 37.5 -40 GHz and 42.5 -43.5 GHz spectrum frequency ranges between IMT and Satellite Gateway links, is given below: (a) No challenges in coexistence of sharing of bands between IMT and Satellite as mmWave network deployment is expected to be more focused on meeting capacity demand in selective geographies. (b) This is a well -researched subject globally proving that co -existence is possible, and there are well established mitigation measures recommended to obviate any such risk. (c) Sharing is highly feasible considering the small separation distances required to avoid interference, coupled with the relatively limited number and known locations of satellite gateways and the expected use of IMT for providing additional capacity in limited areas. (d) Sharing studies at ITU show that coexistence between IMT and satellite gateway in these bands are possible. (e) The spectrum can be efficiently shared between IMT and satellite gateway links. A light -licensing regime to allow the registration of links and coordination with other operators. 2.123 A broad summary of the comments of stakeholders who suggested measures for sharing of 37.5 -40 GHz and 42.5 -43.5 GHz spectrum frequency ranges between IMT and Satellite Gateway links, is given below: 61 (a) Satellite Earth Station gateways (SESGs) should be permitted to be established at uninhabited or remote locations. As satellite gateways will be few in numbers and primarily in rural areas, sharing of spectrum between IMT and satellite gateways can be easily ensured through the appropriate exclusion zones. (b) An appropriate protection/ keep-off distance should be prescribed between IMT stations and SESG for the purposes of co -existence in the frequency ranges. Based on the WRC -19 studies referred to in the Consultation Paper, 4 km would be a safe protection distance. On the other hand, some stakeholders mentioned that they support use of pfd thresholds as opposed to static protection/ keep off distances. (c) The present as well as planned locations of satellite hub stations must be made available prior to auctions. Post auctions, any new hub station may be allowed to be established only in areas with no existing IMT base station. (d) A software defined automated process on a portal may be created having database of coordinates of the proposed earth station in the spectrum bands under consultation. The geofencing coordinates of the proposed earth station in these spectrum bands under discussion, can provide the feasibility results through the portal for establishing earth station. (e) ITU Resolution 243 (WRC -19) and the CEPT Report 82 for 5G mobile networks in the 40.5 – 43.5 GHz band may be applied. (f) For the 42.5 -43.5 GHz band, ITU -R recommendation ITU -R M.216136 - ‘Guidelines to assist administrations to mitigate in-band interference from fixed-satellite service earth stations operating in the frequency bands 24.65-25.25 GHz, 27 -27.5 GHz, 42.5 -43.5 GHz and 47.2 -48.2 GHz into IMT stations’ should be implemented. (g) The proposed new IMT deployment in these bands should no way constrain the existing or future deployment satellite gateway earth stations citing alibi of possible interference from satellite uplink stations. 36 https://www.itu.int/dms_pubrec/itu-r/rec/m/R-REC-M.2161-0-202312-I!!PDF-E.pdf 62 Therefore, to implement appropriate interference mitigation measures should lie with IMT stations.

(h) A few stakeholders were of the view that c o-existence should be left to the parties sharing these frequencies directly (instead of imposing blanket restrictions on keep-off distance or power levels). SESG should be allowed to operate anywhere, even near or in urban areas, as locating SESG near internet points of presence helps to reduce service latency. Analysis of the issues raised through the Q11 and Q12 2.124 Most of the stakeholders were of the opinion that there is no challenge in sharing of spectrum in the frequency ranges under consideration between IMT and Satellite gateway links. However, a few stakeholders have mentioned that there could be challenges in the coexistence between IMT and Satellite gateway links. 2.125 A few stakeholders have suggested that the satellite Earth station gateway s (SESGs) should be permitted to be established at uninhabited or remote locations, and as satellite gateways will be few in numbers and primarily in rural areas, sharing of spectrum between IMT and satellite gateways can be easily ensured through the appropriate exclusion zones. 2.126 The DoT through its reference dated 02.08.2023 mentioned , inter-alia, that 37.5-40 GHz frequency range will also be shared with satellite gateway Earth Stations with suitable protection. Considering that this frequency range, i.e. 37.5-40 GHz is identified for Fixed Satellite Service ( FSS) space-to-earth communication, provisions of Article 21 of ITU -RR already exist for sharing of frequency bands amongst terrestrial and space services. 2.127 It is further noted that the WRC -19 Resolution 243 on the subject ‘Terrestrial component of International Mobile Telecommunications in the frequency bands 37-43.5 GHz and 47.2-48.2 GHz’ resolves as under: 63 “1. that administrations wishing to implement IMT consider use of the frequency band 37-43.5 GHz, or portions thereof, and the frequency band 47.2- 48.2 GHz, identified for IMT in No. 5.550B and No. 5.553B, and the benefits of harmonized utilization of the spectrum for the terrestrial component of IMT taking into account the latest relevant ITU-R Recommendations; 2. that, in order to ensure coexistence between IMT in the frequency bands 37- 43.5 GHz and 47.2 -48.2 GHz as identified by this conference in Article 5 and other services to which the frequency band is allocated, including the protection of these other services, administrations shall apply the following condition(s): 2.1. in order to protect the Earth exploration satellite service (EESS) (passive) in the frequency band 36 -37 GHz, the following unwanted emissions of IMT stations operating in the frequency band 37 -40.5 GHz apply as specified in Table 1 below: Table 1 Frequency band for the EESS (passive) Frequency band for IMT stations Unwanted emission mean power for IMT stations1 Recommended limits for IMT stations1 36-37 GHz 37-40.5 GHz −43 dB(W/MHz) and −23 dB(W/GHz) within the frequency band 36-37 GHz −30 dB(W/GHz) 1 The unwanted emission power level is considered in terms of total radiated power (TRP). The TRP is to be understood here as the integral of the power transmitted from all antenna elements in different directions over the entire radiation sphere. 2.2. protection of space research service (SRS) earth stations in the frequency band 37-38 GHz and RAS stations in the frequency band 42.5 -43.5 GHz from IMT stations should be facilitated through bilateral agreements for cross-border coordination as necessary; 64 2.3. protection of and coexistence with fixed -satellite service (FSS) earth stations within the frequency ranges 37.5-43.5 GHz and 47.2-48.2 GHz should be facilitated through bilateral agreements for cross -border coordination as necessary; 2.4. take practical measures to ensure the transmitting antennas of outdoor base stations are normally pointing below the horizon, when deploying IMT base stations within the frequency bands 42.5 -43.5 GHz and 47.2 -48.2 GHz; the mechanical pointing needs to be at or below the horizon; 2.5. as far as practicable, sites for IMT base stations in the frequency bands 42.5-43.5 GHz and 47.2-48.2 GHz employing values of equivalent isotropically radiated power (e.i.r.p.) per beam exceeding 30 dB(W/200 MHz) should be selected so that the directi on of maximum",

The Authority is also of the view that in case challenges in coexistence of IMT and satellite earth station gateways are observed in the future, the DoT with the help of the Telecommunication Engineering Center (TEC), may come out with necessary instructions/ guidelines, which will be binding on the relevant spectrum assignees. 65 2.129 In view of the above, the Authority recommends that- (a) The provisions of Article 21 of ITU -RR for terrestrial and space services sharing frequency bands above 1 GHz should be made applicable. (b) For the coexistence of satellite systems and IMT, ITU -RR provisions and ITU recommendations, including WRC -19 Resolution 243, should be made applicable. (c) Spectrum dues for 37.5-40 GHz frequency range should be revised on pro -rata basis for the authorised entities holding auction-acquired spectrum in the LSA, in which the permission for establishing satellite earth station gateway is given in the same frequency range, on account of the establishment of the satellite earth station gateways including the exclusion zone, if any. (d) In case certain challenges are encountered in the future in the coexistence of IMT and satellite earth station gateways, DoT with the help of the Telecommunication Engineering Center (TEC), may come out with necessary instructions/ guidelines, which will be binding on the relevant spectrum assignees. 2.130 The following chapter analyses the issues related to valuation and reserve price of 37-40 GHz band. 66 Chapter III: Valuation and Reserve Price A. Introduction 3.1 Millimeter Wave (mmWave) boosted networks are taking off globally, delivering multi-gigabit speeds, capacity and exceptional mobile broadband speeds. 37 There are various advantages/potential benefits of mm Wave bands such as it enables higher data rates compared with lower frequencies when used in telecommunications, such as those used for Wi -Fi and cellular networks. It offers increased data capacities, meaning that mmWave networks can handle more traffic compared with other frequencies. mmWave bands are considered suitable bands for small internet of things or IoT devices.38 3.2 Thus, considering the above, it becomes imperative to ensure optimal valuation and reserve price fixation of the mmWave i.e. 37–37.5 GHz and 37.5–40 GHz spectrum bands in order to ensure efficient utilization of these bands. B. Valuation of spectrum 3.3 As already recommended in para 2.27 of these recommendations, the frequency spectrum in 37-37.5 GHz and 37.5-40 GHz frequency ranges should be put to auction in the forthcoming spectrum auction and owing to non - availability of the device ecosystem in 42.5 -43.5 GHz frequency range, it will be prudent that the frequency range 42.5-43.5 GHz is not put to auction in the forthcoming spectrum auction. 37 The unique capabilities of 5G mmWave : Ericson paper https://www.ericsson.com/en/reports-and-papers/further-insights/leveraging-the-potential-of-5g- millimeter-wave 38 https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/millimeter-wave-MM- wave#:~:text=Advantages%20of%20millimeter%20wave&text=It%20enables%20higher%20data% 20rates,its%20higher%20speeds%20and%20bandwidth. 67 3.4 Accordingly, the present chapter deals with the valuation and setting reserve price of 37–37.5 GHz and 37.5–40 GHz frequency ranges. 3.5 As already discussed in the Consultation Paper (CP) dated 04.04.2024, 37–37.5 GHz and 37.5 –40 GHz bands identified for IMT are being contemplated for auction in India for the first time. There is no historical auction data available to conduct comparative analysis involving auction determined prices in India , for these frequency ranges .

There is no historical auction data available to conduct comparative analysis involving auction determined prices in India , for these frequency ranges . Hence, all the valuation methodologies used for IMT|5G spectrum valuation exercise cannot be used for valuation of 37–37.5 GHz and 37.5 –40 GHz frequency bands. According ly, questions related to technical/ spectral efficiency approach and international benchmarking were asked. i. Technical efficiency approach: Use of indexed ADP of 26 GHz 3.6 One of the potential approaches for valuation of 37–37.5 GHz and 37.5–40 GHz spectrum bands could be based on comparative values that can be achieved by using relative spectral efficiency approach where characteristics like capacity of a particular spectrum band can be compared with the same characteristics of another spectrum band. In this context, the following question was raised in the CP: Q13. Whether the value of spectrum in 37 –37.5 GHz, 37.5–40 GHz and 42.5– 43.5 GHz spectrum bands be derived by relating it to the auction determined price/value of spectrum in any other band by using spectral efficiency factor? If yes, with which spectrum b and, should these bands be related and what efficiency factor or formula should be used? Please justify your suggestions. Comments of stakeholders 3.7 Some of the stakeholders have stated that recently discovered auction price as well as the indexed valuation of 26 GHz band in mmWave should be a key component in final valuation in the present exercise. 68 3.8 One stakeholder has further stated that deployment of 26 GHz has not been done in a comprehensive way, and this may create a subdued demand for 37- 42 GHz. Accordingly, the reserve price/block of 37-42 GHz can be estimated to be 50% of that of the reserve p rice/block of 26 GHz spectrum auction in the 2022 auction. 3.9 Some stakeholders stated that spectrum efficiency factor is a subjective parameter dependent on many unknown variables in the industry and each band should be valued based on its economic value and business case, using a marginal revenue approach. Further stating that if market value of 26 GHz is considered for valuation of 37 –37.5 GHz, 37.5 –40 GHz and 42.5 –43.5 GHz spectrum bands, this value should be reduced based on the comparative efficiency and propagation loss of these bands compared to the 26 GHz band. 3.10 On the other hand , another stakeholder stated that currently there is no clarity on the value which may be derived by the operators out of the spectrum in 26 GHz band. Hence, the winning prices in the last auction or the reserve prices for the 2024 auction cannot be considered as fair value of the spectrum in the 26 GHz band and should not be used as benchmark for determining the value of spectrum in 37 –37.5 GHz, 37.5 –40 GHz, and 42.5 –43.5 GHz frequency bands. Analysis 3.11 The details of the 2022 and 2024 auctions for the 26 GHz band are summarized in the table below: 69 Table 3.1: Bidding activity in previous auctions Year of Auction Reserve Price per MHz (Rs. in crore) Quantum of spectrum put to auction (in MHz) Auction price per MHz (Rs. in crore) Quantum of spectrum sold (in MHz) % Quantum of spectrum sold 2022 6.99 62700 (22 LSAs) 6.99 45350 (22 LSAs) 72% 2024 7.61 8700 (21 LSAs) - - - 3.12 As given in the Table above, the Auction determined price (ADP) of July/August 2022 IMT auction of mmWave band (26 GHz) is available in all 22 LSAs. Around 72% of the spectrum put to auction was acquired by the service providers. 3.13 The above band was again put to auction in 2024, at an indexed reserve price of 7.61 crore for 21 LSAs. However, no bids were received during the 2024 auction. Consequently, no Auction Determined Price for the 26 GHz band was derived from the 2024 auction process. As a result, the Auction Determined Price for the 26 GHz band is available only from the 2022 auction. 3.14 Further, it has been noted by the Authority in the past that Economic theory suggests that pricing of a public resource should reflect, as far as possible, its current economic value, so as to encourage its most efficient, optimal and equitable use. 3.15",

This is also termed as Willingness to Pay. The amount or the price paid by the consumer for a good in a market economy is a universally accepted measure of economic value. Thus, the market determined price is considered as the best indicator of economic value of a good. 70 3.16 mmWave bands possess unique characteristics, including high capacity, faster speeds, low latency, and limited propagation and coverage 39. Therefore, the Authority is of the view that considering the similar characteristics of mmWave bands, the auction -discovered prices of the 26 GHz band can serve as a reference point for determining the economic value of the 37–37.5 GHz and 37.5–40 GHz spectrum bands. 3.17 Further, the Authority in 2018 and in 2022 has used the ‘Marginal Cost of Funds based Lending Rates (MCLR) system’ for indexing the last auction determined prices. Accordingly, the Authority is of the view that auction determined prices revealed in the auction held in the year 2022, duly indexed with MCLR, be taken as one of the possible valuations in the present spectrum valuation exercise. 3.18 The authority at para 3.40 of its Recommendations on Auction of Spectrum in frequency bands identified for IMT/5G dated 11.04.2022, recommended that: (I) For existing bands (including for the bands being put to auction for the first time in the forthcoming auction), a fresh spectrum valuation exercise be conducted once every three years; a suitable reference be made to the Authority by Government for this purpose. (II) For auctions conducted in the interim period between periodic valuation exercises conducted once every three years, (1) for LSAs where the spectrum put to auction in a previous auction is sold, the auction determined prices (duly indexed using applicable MCLR if more than one year has elapsed since the previous auction) should be used for arriving at the reserve prices for the next auction; (2) for LSAs, where spectrum remains unsold in previous auctions, past recommended reserve price (without indexation) should be used. 39 https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/Enterprise-5G-Guide-to-planning-architecture-and- benefits 71 3.19 As outlined in paragraph 3.18 above, the Authority vide its Recommendation dated 11.04.2022 recommended that spectrum valuation be conducted every three years, with interim auctions relying on auction -determined prices (ADP) from previous auctions, duly indexed where applicable. 3.20 In line with this recommendation, the ADP of the 26 GHz spectrum band from the 2022 auction, which is available for 22 LSAs, falls within the prescribed three-year timeframe. Given that no bids were received for this band in the 2024 auction, the 2022 ADP, indexed using the applicable MCLR, should be considered as one of the possible valuation benchmarks in the present spectrum valuation exercise, as per the approach outlined in paragraph 3.18. 3.21 Therefore, the Authority is of the view that the auction determined prices of 26 GHz spectrum band auctioned in 2022, duly indexed with MCLR, should be taken as one of the possible values in present spectrum valuation exercise. 3.22 Using this approach, the valuations arrived at for 37–37.5 GHz and 37.5 –40 GHz spectrum bands are tabulated at Annexure 3.1. ii. USE OF INTERNATIONAL SPECTRUM PRICES: 3.23 Another alternative approach for valuation of 37–37.5 GHz and 37.5 –40 GHz bands could be based on international benchmarking. Accordingly, the following questions were raised in the CP: Q14. Should international spectrum prices i.e. the auction determined price/ reserve price of other countries in 37 –37.5 GHz, 37.5–40 GHz and 42.5 –43.5 GHz spectrum bands serve as a basis for the purpose of valuation of these bands?

Please support your suggestions with detailed methodology, related assumptions and other relevant factors, etc. Comments of stakeholders 3.24 One stakeholder stated that in the absence of any empirical data, international benchmarking will be a key measure for valuation of these capacity bands and it should be used to avoid over-valuation. 3.25 Another stakeholder stated that internationally, the auction determined price (ADP) of mmWave spectrum bands comes to less than 1% of the ADP of mid band spectrum. However, in India, the ADP and consequently the subsequent reserve price of 26 GHz spectrum band is over 2% of the 3300 MHz band pricing. Therefore, the valuation for 40 GHz spectrum needs to be rationalized/reduced as compared to the ADP/current reserve price of 26 GHz band keeping in mind the relevant contingent factors like international benchmarking, the higher cost of building terrestrial networks in higher frequency bands, revenue potential etc. 3.26 One stakeholder stated that internationally only a few countries have successfully done auction -based allocation of the spectrum in 37 –37.5 GHz, 37.5–40 GHz, and 42.5–43.5 GHz frequency bands. India as a country presents a different set of opportunities an d challenges. Hence, International benchmarking method may not be an appropriate method in the current scenario. 3.27 Some stakeholders stated that international benchmarking may not be used as there are differences in the levels of maturity of the respective network as well as the social and economic parameters of India when compared with the referred international count ries. Further, spectrum valuation approach must 73 emerge from the industry’s incremental/aggregate RoCE and incremental/marginal revenue generation ability in the spectrum bands being valued. However, in the absence of other reference points this approach could be considered after being normalised to adju st for the Indian telecom sector indices, i.e., ARPU, RoCE, rollout obligations and investment. Analysis 3.28 The Authority in its Recommendations on Auction of Spectrum in frequency bands identified for IMT/5G dated 11th April 2022 used international auction price ratio for valuation of mmWave band (26 GHz). The average auction price ratio was derived by consider ing the country wise ratio of auction prices per MHz per pop40 per year for mmWave bands vis-à-vis mid-band. 3.29 The Authority was of the view that since the ratio is between auction prices of the two bands in the same country, it avoids the problem of cross -country divergences, and thereby no further normalization would be required. 3.30 In the present scenario, only one country, i.e. USA has conducted the auction of the mmWave spectrum bands. While other two countries, namely UK and Canada, have decided to auction the mmwave bands. Thus, the auction determined price ratio is available for only one country, whereas the relative reserve price ratios between the above-mentioned bands are available for two countries i.e. UK and Canada. 3.31 As mentioned earlier, auction -determined price (ADP) ratios are available for one country (USA), while reserve price (RP) ratios are available for two countries (UK and Canada). However, unlike ADP, reserve prices are not determined by the market dynamics of demand and supply. Therefore, RP 40 pop refers to population 74 ratios have not been considered for spectrum valuation, as they may not provide an accurate or reliable measure of the market value of spectrum bands. 3.32 In this context, the Authority has consistently relied on auction -determined prices in its previous valuation exercises, as these prices more accurately reflect the value the market places on spectrum bands. Nevertheless, to provide additional information and insights, details regarding the reserve prices for the USA, the UK, and Canada are included in Annexure 3.2. 3.33 Internationally, only USA has conducted auction for 24.25–25.25 GHz spectrum band and also for 37 and 39 GHz spectrum bands. The ratio of auction prices per MHz per pop per year of 37 GHz band vis -à-vis 24 GHz is as tabulated below: -",

The ratio of auction prices per MHz per pop per year of 37 GHz band vis -à-vis 24 GHz is as tabulated below: - Table 3.2: International Auction price ratios (USA) S.No Particulars 24.25-24.45 and 24.75-25.25 GHz (A) 37.6-40 GHz (B) 1 Auction determined price per MHz per pop per year (US$) (License duration =10 year) 0.000878797 0.000914998 2 Ratio (B/A) 1.04 3.34 The Authority is of the view that the international auction price ratio of two bands reflects the relative values placed by the market internationally on the respective bands. This ratio will be independent of cross-country divergences. 3.35 Since 37–37.5 GHz and 37.5 –40 GHz bands are decided to be put to auction for the first time in India, there is lack of dataset for the valuation of these bands. Hence, the Authority is of the view that it may be beneficial to consider the international prices as well to enhance the valuati on efficiency of these bands. 75 3.36 Therefore, the Authority is of the view that the international auction determined price ratios should be taken as one of the possible values in present spectrum valuation exercise. 3.37 Using this approach, the valuations arrived at for the 37 –37.5 GHz and 37.5– 40 GHz spectrum bands are given at Annexure 3.1. C. Average Valuation and Reserve Price Fixation 3.38 It has been the Authority’s position over the years that the various approaches used in the valuation of different spectrum bands have their respective merits and constraints. Rather than relying on one valuation approach, it is prudent and rational to rely on a number of approaches to arrive at the final valuation. It is not possible to claim deterministically that any one of these models/ approaches is absolutely the right approach to arrive at the valuation, since no single approach can completely and ex actly capture every variable that influences the valuation of spectrum. It is well-nigh impossible to calculate the complete range of possible valuations. Therefore, the Authority has been consistently maintaining that rather than following a deterministic approach, it is best to work with a probabilistic average valuation (through simple mean) that captures the range of possible valuations 3.39 During previous valuation exercise, the Authority estimated the value of spectrum using various valuation models and taking a mean of value derived from all approaches and the reserve price was set at 70% of the average valuation. A reserve price refers to the lower bound on the bid below which the item up for sale cannot be acquired through an auction. 3.40 Accordingly, the following questions were raised in this regard in the CP for seeking the comments of the stakeholders: 76 Q16. Whether the value arrived at by using any single valuation approach for a particular spectrum band should be taken as the appropriate value of that band? If yes, please suggest which single approach/method should be used. Please support your answer with detailed justification. Q.17 In case your response to the above question is negative, will it be appropriate to take the average valuation (simple mean) of the valuations obtained through the different approaches attempted for valuation of a particular spectrum band, or some othe r approach like taking weighted mean etc. should be followed? Please support your answer with detailed justification. Q18. What ratio should be adopted between the reserve price for the auction and the valuation of the spectrum in these spectrum bands and why? Please support your answer with detailed justification. Comments of stakeholders 3.41 No specific comments have been received from stakeholders on the issues raised in Q.16 and Q.17. However in response to the issue of reserve price fixation, raised in Q.18, majority of stakeholders have stated that reserve price should be kept at 50% of the valuation of the spectrum. They are of the opinion that 50% is an optimum ratio to determine true valuation, promote new investments, reduce entry barriers, and promote competition, encourage wider participation of the TSPs in acquisition of spectrum etc. Analysis 3.42 The Authority has carefully considered the",

They are of the opinion that 50% is an optimum ratio to determine true valuation, promote new investments, reduce entry barriers, and promote competition, encourage wider participation of the TSPs in acquisition of spectrum etc. Analysis 3.42 The Authority has carefully considered the comments of the stakeholders. Since September 2013, the Authority has been conducting spectrum valuation by taking the simple mean of the valuations obtained from the various valuation approaches, on the assumptio n of equal probability of occurrence of each valuation approach. 77 3.43 This approach is justified since the attempt is to arrive at the ‘Expected Value’ of the valuation of spectrum from the set of available valuations, and the simple mean serves this purpose as a measure of central location. Accordingly, the Authority has de cided to use different spectrum valuation approaches, whichever feasible, and take the simple mean of the valuations obtained through the different approaches used for valuation of the spectrum band, to arrive at the average valuation. 3.44 Thus, the average valuation of 37–37.5 GHz and 37.5–40 GHz bands for each LSA is tabulated below. The valuations arrived at using different approaches for 37–37.5 GHz and 37.5–40 GHz bands are given at Annexure 3.1. Table 3.3 Average Value per MHz in 37–37.5 GHz and 37.5–40 GHz bands (Rs. in crore) LSA Category Average Value Andhra Pradesh A 0.70 Assam C 0.12 Bihar C 0.33 Delhi Metro 1.09 Gujarat A 0.61 Haryana B 0.16 Himachal Pradesh C 0.06 J&K C 0.04 Karnataka A 0.49 Kerala B 0.23 Kolkata Metro 0.39 Madhya Pradesh B 0.36 Maharasthra A 0.77 Mumbai Metro 0.96 North East C 0.04 Odisha C 0.15 Punjab B 0.24 78 Rajasthan B 0.31 Tamilnadu A 0.56 U.

The Authority is of the view that in order to ensure competitive bidding and price discovery, the reserve price may continue to be set at 70% of average valuation. 3.48 Accordingly, the Authority recommends that the reserve price for 37– 37.5 GHz and 37.5–40 GHz bands should be set at 70% of the average valuation arrived at. 3.49 Thus, the recommended reserve price of 37 –37.5 GHz and 37.5 –40 GHz bands for each LSA is tabulated below: - Table-3.4 Recommended Reserve Price (per MHz) in 37–37.5 GHz and 37.5–40 GHz bands (Rs. in crore) LSA Category Recommended Reserve price Andhra Pradesh A 0.49 Assam C 0.09 Bihar C 0.23 79 Delhi Metro 0.76 Gujarat A 0.43 Haryana B 0.11 Himachal Pradesh C 0.04 J&K C 0.03 Karnataka A 0.34 Kerala B 0.16 Kolkata Metro 0.27 Madhya Pradesh B 0.25 Maharashtra A 0.54 Mumbai Metro 0.67 North East C 0.03 Odisha C 0.10 Punjab B 0.17 Rajasthan B 0.21 Tamil Nadu A 0.39 U.

At least a 6 -year moratorium period should be allowed, in order for TSPs to be able to start realizing revenues from the spectrum before they have to make the payments for the same. A total of 14 annual instalments, after the 6 years moratorium period, should be fixed – with no upfront payment requirement. This will enable TSPs to invest in network rollout. Huge interest on deferred spectrum payments defeats the purpose of allowing a moratorium. Therefore, no interest should be levied on deferred payments. And in case interest has to be levied, it should be at the repo rate, and not the SBI PLR/MCLR, as repo rate is adequate to protect the time value of money. SBI PLR/MCLR imposes unwarranted financial burden on TSPs. 3.51 Other stakeholders have stated that the payment terms should be relaxed. The upfront payment should be kept only at 10% of the bid amount and thereafter minimum 5 -year moratorium without any interest cost should be provided. They further added that the deferred payment for auction discovered spectrum price, should be spread over the remaining 15 years by way of annual payments. These annual payments should be charged with the reasonable interest rates of 6.5% as specified by RBI Repo rate, in place of curre nt prohibitive interest rates.

Option 2: Payment of 20 equal annual instalments of the bid amount, duly protecting the NPV of the bid amount at the applicable rate of interest, in advance at the beginning of the year, the first instalment becoming payable within 10 calendar days from the issuance of Demand Note by DoT. The balance 19 instalments shall become due and payable on the Effective Date anniversary of each following year.” 3.53 The Authority is of the view that similar payment terms shall be adopted for assignment of 37–37.5 GHz and 37.5–40 GHz spectrum bands. 3.54 Accordingly, the Authority recommends that the following options for payment terms should be allowed for assignment of 37–37.5 GHz and 37.5–40 GHz spectrum bands: (a) Option 1: Full or part upfront payment of the bid amount within 10 calendar days from the issuance of Demand Note.

(b) Band pan n260 with TDD -based duplexing configuration should be adopted for 37-40 GHz frequency range. (c) Owing to the non-availability of the device ecosystem in 42.5- 43.5 GHz frequency range, it will be prudent that the frequency range 42.5 -43.5 GHz is not put to auction in the forthcoming spectrum auction. The DoT may send a separate reference for seeking the Authority’s recommendations for 42.5-43.5 GHz frequency range for IMT at an appropriate time. [Para 2.27] 4.2 The Authority recommends that the frequency spectrum in the band n260 (37-40 GHz) should be auctioned with a validity period of 20 years. [Para 2.37] 4.3 The Authority recommends that the frequency spectrum in the band n260 (37 -40 GHz) should be auctioned on LSA (Telecom Circle/ Metro) basis. [Para 2.44] 4.4 The Authority recommends that the frequency band n260 (37 -40 GHz) should be auctioned with a block size of 100 MHz, and the minimum number of blocks for bidding should be one. Further, DoT should ensure that in case a telecom service provider acquires more 84 than one block, entire spectrum assigned to a telecom service provider is in a contiguous manner. [Para 2.54] 4.5 The Authority recommends that spectrum cap for the frequency band n260 (37-40 GHz) should be kept as 40% of the total spectrum put to auction and it should not be clubbed with 26 GHz band for the purpose of spectrum cap. [Para 2.67] 4.6 The Authority recommends that (a) The minimum roll-out obligations for band n260 (37 -40 GHz) should be similar to that prescribed for 26 GHz band in the NIA, 2024. (b) The minimum roll-out obligations should be equally applicable for all the TSPs i.e., existing as well as the new TSPs. [Para 2.85] 4.7 The Authority recommends that - (a) In addition to the entities holding the access service authorisation, the following entities should also be permitted to participate in the auction of spectrum for frequency band n260 (37-40 GHz): (i) The entities holding Internet service authorisation holders for category ‘A’ and category ‘B’ service area (ii) The entities holding authorisation for M2M service category A/ B under the Unified License, or M2M WAN Service Authorisation with service area as national (category-A) or Telecom circle/ Metro Area (Category -B), as recommended by the Authority through Recommendations dated 18.09.2024. 85 (b) The successful bidders will be permitted to use the acquired spectrum to offer service as per the scope of their respective service authorisations. (c) The relevant security related provisions should be included in the Internet Service Authorisation and M2M WAN Service Authorisation which should become applicable if such authorisation holders acquire access spectrum. (d) The existing provisions for the surrender of access spectrum should be extended to all successful bidders, including Internet Service providers and M2M WAN service Authorisation. (e) Regarding spectrum sharing, trading, and leasing, the provisions that need to be made applicable for ISPs and M2M WAN service providers, require detailed examination and consultation with stakeholders. Therefore, in case DoT agrees with the Authority’s recommendation to permit such entities to participate in the spectrum auction for the frequency band n260 (37-40 GHz), it may go ahead with the spectrum auction, and if required, it may subsequently send a separate reference to the Authority with respect to sharing, trading and leasing of spectrum among such entities.

[Para 2.109] 4.8 The Authority recommends that to mitigate inter -operator interference in 37 -40 GHz band with TDD configuration, the following measures should be taken – (a) In case a TSP acquires more than one block, the entire spectrum should be assigned to it in a contiguous manner. (b) In case a TSP acquires spectrum in more than one LSA, same frequency spots should be assigned to it in all those LSAs, to the extent possible. (c) Interference mitigation should be left to the mutual coordination between the TSPs. 86 [Para 2.115] 4.9 The Authority recommends that- (a) The provisions of Article 21 of ITU -RR for terrestrial and space services sharing frequency bands above 1 GHz should be made applicable. (b) For the coexistence of satellite systems and IMT, ITU -RR provisions and ITU recommendations, including WRC -19 Resolution 243, should be made applicable. (c) Spectrum dues for 37.5 -40 GHz frequency range should be revised on pro -rata basis for the authorised entities holding auction-acquired spectrum in the LSA, in which the permission for establishing satellite earth station gateway is given in the same frequency range, on account of the establishment of the satellite earth station gateways including the exclusion zone, if any. (d) In case certain challenges are encountered in the future in the coexistence of IMT and satellite earth station gateways, DoT with the help of the Telecommunication Engineering Center (TEC), may come out with necessary instructions/ guidelines, which will be binding on the relevant spectrum assignees. [Para 2.129] 4.10 The Authority recommends that the reserve price for 37 –37.5 GHz and 37.5 –40 GHz bands should be set at 70% of the average valuation arrived at. [Para 3.48] 87 4.11 The recommended reserve price of 37 –37.5 GHz and 37.5 –40 GHz bands for each LSA is tabulated below: - Table-3.4 Recommended Reserve Price (per MHz) in 37–37.5 GHz and 37.5–40 GHz bands (Rs. in crore) LSA Category Recommended Reserve price Andhra Pradesh A 0.49 Assam C 0.09 Bihar C 0.23 Delhi Metro 0.76 Gujarat A 0.43 Haryana B 0.11 Himachal Pradesh C 0.04 J&K C 0.03 Karnataka A 0.34 Kerala B 0.16 Kolkata Metro 0.27 Madhya Pradesh B 0.25 Maharashtra A 0.54 Mumbai Metro 0.67 North East C 0.03 Odisha C 0.10 Punjab B 0.17 Rajasthan B 0.21 Tamil Nadu A 0.39 U.

    "text": "Recommendations on Working Guidelines for Spectrum Trading New Delhi 28th January, 2014 Mahanagar Doorsanchar Bhawan, JawaharLal Nehru Marg, New Delhi-110002 Telecom Regulatory Authority of India i TABLE OF CONTENTS CHAPTER TITLE PAGE NO. I. Background 1 II. Working Guidelines on Spectrum Trading 7 1 CHAPTER-I BACKGROUND 1.1 Historically, the use of radio spectrum has been highly regulated . In most countries, the regulator has used command and control mechanism to decide the allocation of spectrum. However, over the past two decades, there has been a growing consensus that because of a significant increase in the demand for spectrum, the hitherto prevalent regulatory paradigm would prove inadequate to deal with the situation in hand. Spectrum license holders, needed flexibility to respond quickly to changes in market demand and technology; the old paradigm would only result in inefficient use of available spectrum and creation of artificial scarcity. This is why policymakers and regulators worldwide have devoted their attention to new ways of spectrum regulation with an increasing emphasis on evolving more flexible and market oriented models to increase opportunities for efficient spectrum usage. Spectrum managers are following diverse approaches for sharing frequenci es viz. spectrum sha ring, spectrum leasing, spectrum trading, as well as unlicensed spectrum combined with the use of low power radios or advanced radio technologies including ultra wideband and multi -model radios. 1.2 Spectrum trading contributes to a more ec onomical and efficient use of frequencies. This is because a trade will only take place if the spectrum is worth more to the new user than it was to the old user, reflecting the greater economic benefit the new user expects to derive from its use. It allows the present user to decide when and to whom the spectrum authorisation will be transferred and what sum it will receive in return. The market, not the regulator, determines the value. Spectrum trading makes it possible for companies to expand more quic kly than would otherwise be the case. It also makes it easier for a new market entrant to acquire spectrum in order to enter the market. 2 1.3 In the last decade, a number of countries like USA, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Guatemala have permitted spectrum t rading in the secondary market as an additional means of spectrum distribution. In European Union (EU), Article 9 of the current EU Framework Directive allows member States to provide for the transfer of spectrum rights with certain requirements. As per the Electronic Communications Committee (ECC) Report 1, in EU there are 13 countries viz. Austria, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Lithuania, Norway, Slovak Republic, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, UK where usage rights can be partially traded in frequencies. 1.4 In India too, the issue of spectrum trading was considered by the Authority in its Recommendations on ‘Spectrum Management and Licensing Framework’ dated 11 th May, 2010 and again in its Recommendations on ‘Auction of Spectrum’ dated 23 rd April, 2012. In these Recommendations, the Authority noted that in countries where spectrum trading was permitted, the spectrum is normally assigned through a market mechanism. However, in India except for 3G/BWA spectrum, all other spectrum available wit h the TSPs (Telecom Service Provider) had been obtained through an administrative process without paying its market price. Therefore, permitting such TSPs to trade in such administratively allocated spectrum would result in unearned windfall gains to such TSPs. Moreover, this might also result in anti - competitive conduct through consolidation/hoarding of spectrum or through incumbent s precluding newcomers from providing service by buying out the spectrum necessary for such service. Therefore, the Authority did not recommend permitting spectrum trading at that point of time. 1.5 Subsequently, in December 2012 and March 2013, the Department of Telecommunications (DoT), issued orders for levy of one -time spectrum charges (OTC) for GSM/CDMA spectrum held by the incumbent TSPs for spectrum above 6.2 MHz/5 MHz for GSM/CDMA for the period 1 ECC Report on ‘Description of Practices Relative to Trading of Spectrum Rights of Use’, May 2011 3 01.07.2008 to 31.12.2012 and for spectrum above 4.4 MHz/2.5 MHz for GSM/CDMA from 01.01.2013. The OTC to be levied for spectrum above 4.4 MHz/2.5 MHz was to be based on auction determined price. Therefore, in response to the DoT's reference dated 10 th July 2013, seeking TRAI’s recommendations on the applicable reserve price for the auction of spectrum in the 800 MHz, 900 MHz and 1800 MHz, the Authority suo-motu decided to include the issue of permitting spectrum trading in the country in the Consultation Paper (CP). In the meanwhile, another reference was received from the DoT dated 22 nd August, 2013, which sought TRAI’s recommendations on permitting trading of spectrum obtained through auction and the attendant legal, regulatory and technical framework. 1.6 The Authority in its recommendations on ‘Valuation and Reserve price",

    "text": "ECC Report on ‘Description of Practices Relative to Trading of Spectrum Rights of Use’, May 2011 3 01.07.2008 to 31.12.2012 and for spectrum above 4.4 MHz/2.5 MHz for GSM/CDMA from 01.01.2013. The OTC to be levied for spectrum above 4.4 MHz/2.5 MHz was to be based on auction determined price. Therefore, in response to the DoT's reference dated 10 th July 2013, seeking TRAI’s recommendations on the applicable reserve price for the auction of spectrum in the 800 MHz, 900 MHz and 1800 MHz, the Authority suo-motu decided to include the issue of permitting spectrum trading in the country in the Consultation Paper (CP). In the meanwhile, another reference was received from the DoT dated 22 nd August, 2013, which sought TRAI’s recommendations on permitting trading of spectrum obtained through auction and the attendant legal, regulatory and technical framework. 1.6 The Authority in its recommendations on ‘Valuation and Reserve price of Spectrum’ dated 9 th September 2013 examined the issues associated with spectrum trading in detail and noted that:  Earlier spectrum trading was not allowed primarily on the ground that T elecom Service Providers (T SPs) had obtained spectrum through an administrative process without paying its market price. Therefore, allowing such TSPs to trade in spectrum would have resulted in unearned windfall gains to such TSPs. That concern has been taken care of because t he Government has decided tha t all TSPs will have to a pay one - time charge at a market-determined price for their existing spectrum holding beyond 4.4 MHz/2.5MHz for GSM/CDMA for the remaining validity period of the licenses.  The average spectrum holdings of TSPs in India are low in comparison with internat ional standards. There is an urgent need for consolidation of spectrum holdings. The Authority has already given its recommendations to the Government in November 2011 on guidelines for Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A) in the industry. However, the DoT has not yet announced 4 the final guidelines. As such, presently no mechanism exists for a telecom company to exit the sector after trading its spectrum holding. Thus, companies (investors) who entered the industry are locked-in: there is no way out (surrendering spectrum to the Government without receiving any refund is a commercial non - option). 1.7 The Authority also observed that consolidation could also be facilitated by allowing market forces to operate i.e. by permitting spectrum trading as it allows far more specific and targeted reallocations of spectrum than can be reached through M&A activity. A TSP holding spectrum that is paid for but in excess of its current requirements would then be able to directly trade these holdings with another TSP which req uires additional spectrum for its operations. This would help to ensure optimal allocative efficiency of this limited natural resource, making the sector as a whole better off in the bargain. Clarity on the policy framework with regard to spectrum trading would help to unlock the full potential value of spectrum that was proposed to be auctioned. 1.8 In the said recommendations of 9 th September 2013, the Authorit y recommended the following on spectrum trading: a. Spectrum trading should be permitted in the country. Initially, only outright transfer of spectrum should be permitted. b. The eligibility conditions for spectrum trading and participation in spectrum auctions should be the same. c. Only that spectrum should be allowed to be traded which has either been obtained through auction or on which the TSP has paid the prescribed market value to the Government. This will also include the spectrum in 2100 MHz and 2300 MHz bands. In case, the spectrum being traded by the TSP was assigned to it administratively, the prescri bed market value shall be payable to the Government after adjusting the entry fee paid by the TSP for 5 acquiring the spectrum (bundled with licence) prorated for the remaining validity of the spectrum. After the first trade, the spectrum shall be at par wit h the spectrum acquired through auction. Through trading, the validity period of spectrum will not change. d. The seller and the purchaser shall be required to inform the Licensor about the spectrum trade. However, no permission shall be required from the Licensor/ Government. The information of the prospective trade is for the purpose of updating the spectrum register. The register should be updated within a maximum time of eight weeks. On expiry of the time limit, the spectrum trade will be treated as effective. e. Trading transactions should be subject to the spectrum cap of 50% of the spectrum in a band and 25% of the total commercial spectrum assigned in an LSA. f. In case a TSP wishes to sell its spectrum through spectrum trading, after completion of the roll -out obligations, the TSP will be permitted to sell the access spectrum",

In case a TSP wishes to sell its spectrum through spectrum trading, after completion of the roll -out obligations, the TSP will be permitted to sell the access spectrum in parts, subject to the minimum quantum of spectrum permitted for trading. However, in case the TSP has not fulfilled its roll -out obligations, then it will have to sell its entire holding of access spectrum and the roll -out obligations will also be transferred to the transferee. g. A transfer fee of one percent (1%) of the transactional amoun t or the prescribed market price, whichever is higher should be imposed on all spectrum trade transactions. The transfer fee should be paid by the transferee to the Government. h. If, after a trade, spectrum is intended to be used for any purpose other than i ts present use, then the details of the technology have to be submitted to the WPC, so as to ensure that the intended use does not create any interference with other users. 6 1.9 In the recommendations of September 2013, the Authority also recommended that “ The Government may first accept the above recommendations relating to spectrum trading. After the acceptance of the recommendations is conveyed to TRAI, the Authority shall constitute a Steering Committee consisting of TSPs and Industry Associations to work out the details of the implementation issues” 1.10 In its back -reference dated 11 th October 2013, the DoT conveyed its in-principle acceptance of Authority's recommendation to permit spectrum trading in the country . Accordingly, in its response dated 23rd October 2013, the Authority informed the DoT that it would shortly work out the detailed guidelines for its implementation. 1.11 Subsequently , the Authority constituted a Steering Committee of nominated senior officers of TRAI and representatives from various TSPs viz. Aircel, Bharti Airtel, BSNL, Idea, Loop, MTNL, RCOM, Reliance Jio, SSTL, TTSL, Telewings, Videocon, and Vodafone for framing the working guidelines for spectrum t rading in the country. After detailed deliberations in a number of mee tings, the Steering Committee submitted its report containing the draft guidelines on spectrum trading to the Authority. On most of the issues, there was generally unanimity amongst the Steering Committee members. The Authority analysed the draft guideline s submitted by the Steering Committee and has finalized its recommendations on ‘Guidelines on Spectrum Trading’. Chapter II contains the Guidelines on s pectrum trading. 7 CHAPTER-II WORKING GUIDELINES ON SPECTRUM TRADING The Authority recommends following working guidelines on spectrum trading: 2.1 Spectrum trading refers to the transfer of rights to use the spectrum. The words ‘seller’ and ‘buyer’ are used in the context of transferring the rights from one user to another. When a block of spectrum is traded, the associated rights and obligations of the spectrum block shall stand transferred from the seller to the buyer. 2.2 Under spectrum trading, only outright transfer of spectrum is permitted, i.e. the ownership of the usage right is transferred to the buyer. Spectrum leasing is not permitted at this point of time. 2.3 Spectrum trading will not alter the original validity period of spectrum assignment. 2.4 All dues and recoveries till the effective date of transfer shall lie with the seller and after the trade is effected, all dues and recoveries shall lie with the buyer of the spectrum. 2.5 A licensee shall not be allowed to trade in spectrum if it has been established that it is in breach of terms and conditions of the licence and the Licensor has ordered for revocation/termination of its licence. 2.6 For the present, Spectrum Trading shall be permitted only on a pan-LSA (Licensed Service Area) basis i.e. spectrum cannot be traded for a part of the LSA. In case the spectrum assigned to the seller is restricted to part of the LSA by the Licensor, then, after trading, the rights and obligations of the seller for the remaining part of the LSA with regard to assignment of that spectrum shall also stand transferred to the buyer. 8 Example: Suppose, due to non–availability of spectrum in some of the districts of an",

In case the spectrum assigned to the seller is restricted to part of the LSA by the Licensor, then, after trading, the rights and obligations of the seller for the remaining part of the LSA with regard to assignment of that spectrum shall also stand transferred to the buyer. 8 Example: Suppose, due to non–availability of spectrum in some of the districts of an LSA, spectrum has been assigned to a TSP (seller) in only some parts of an LSA (say in 22 districts out of total 33 districts of Rajasthan) with a promise to assign spectrum in the remaining on its availability and it transfers its right to use the spectrum to another TSP (buyer) through spectrum trading. Then, whenever spectrum in remaining 11 districts become available, the spectrum in these districts shall be assigned to the buyer as per the promise to the seller , after the payment of the balance amount for the remaining 11 districts, if applicable. 2.7 The seller and the buyer shall be required to inform the Licensor regarding the spectrum trade, 6 weeks prior to the effective date of trade. However, no permission will be required from the Licensor/Government for Spectrum Trading. 2.8 Spectrum trading will be permitted only in the following bands: i. All spectrum bands earmarked for Access Services by t he Licensor will be treated as tradable spectrum bands. Currently spectrum in 800MHz, 900MHz, 1800MHz, 2100MHz, 2300MHz and 2500MHz spectrum bands have been allocated for Access Services. ii. Only that spectrum in the above mentioned bands (in sub -para (i)) is permissible to be traded which has either been assigned through an auction in the year 2010 or afterwards , or on which the Telecom Service Provider (TSP) has already paid the prescribed market value (as decided by the Government from time to time) to the Government. 2.9 Spectrum t rading shall be permitted only in the following block sizes (band wise): Table-1 Spectrum band Block Size 800 MHz 2x1.25 MHz 900 MHz 2x200 KHz 9 1800 MHz 2x200 KHz 2100 MHz 2x5 MHz 2300 MHz 20 MHz in TDD 2500 MHz 20 MHz in TDD and 2x10 in FDD Option for permitting spectrum trading in a smaller block size for 2300 MHz and 2500 MHz band was also examined. However, in view of the fact that in TDD duplexing scheme, there is a requirement of substantial guard-band between spectrum assignments of different TSPs and reducing the block size from 20 MHz to 10 MHz would lead to wastage of precious spectrum, it has been decided to keep the block -size the same as wa s prescribed during the assignment of spectrum through the auction by the Licensor. 2.10 The terms and conditions attached to the spectrum under the provisions specified in the relevant Notice Inviting Application (NIA) document or otherwise shall continue to a pply after the transfer of spectrum unless specifically mentioned in these guidelines. 2.11 The following eligibility conditions shall be applicable for participating in spectrum trading: i. Only CMTS/UASL/UL (AS)/UL licensees shall be eligible to participate in the spectrum trading. The entire spectrum held by the licensee in a particular spectrum band within an LSA sho uld be tradable i.e. it has either been assigned through an auction in the year 2010 or afterwards, or on which the TSP has already paid the presc ribed market value (as decided by the Government from time to time) to the Government. ii. The requirement for net worth and paid -up equity capital of the buyer shall be as given below:  For participating in trading, the net worth requirement of the buyer would be Rs. 100 Crore for each service area except for J ammu & Kashmir and North-East Service Areas, where it will be Rs. 50 Crore for each service area. The net worth shall be as defined in the 10 Companies Act 2013, as amended from time to time. The buyer shall submit a certificate to this effect (provided by the Company Secretary/Statutory Auditors of the Applicant Company and countersigned by the duly authorized Director of applicant Company) while intimating the WPC about the trade.  The net worth of those promoters having at least 10 % paid -up equity holding in the company participating in the spectrum trading (buyer)",

This paid -up equity requirement would be in addition to the prescribed paid -up equity for obtaining Unified Licence.  The minimum paid -up equity requirements for obtaining the spectrum shall be met and maintained till the validity period of the right to use spectrum. Example: Suppose a buyer (company A) intends to participate in spectrum trading in the two service areas of Andhra Pradesh and Jammu & Kashmir. Suppose company A’s paid -up equity capital is Rs E and its net worth is Rs N . Also suppose that the X, Y, and Z are the three promoters of company A holding paid -up equity capital of 0.5E, 0.45E and 0.05E respectively and that each promoter has a net worth of X n, Yn, and Zn respectively. Then,  The buyer’s net worth requirement shall be Rs 150 crore (Rs 100 crore + Rs 50 crore).  For the buyer to meet the net worth requirement, 11 N + Xn + Yn shall be ≥ Rs 150 crore (since Xn and Yn represent the net worth of promoters X and Y who each hold paid -up equity capital ≥ 10% of E, while Z n is not taken into account because promoter Z holds paid-up equity capital < 10% of E; E being the paid -up equity capital of company A and N being company A’s net worth)  Further, it shall also be required that E shall be ≥ Rs 15 crore (i.e., 10% of Rs 150 crore)  Company A shall maintain its net worth requirement for the validity period of the right to use spectrum. iii. The buyer should be in compliance of the spectrum cap (ceiling) of 25% of its total spectrum holding in 800/900/1800/2100/2300/2500 MHz bands with applicable paired band put together and 50% within a given band in each of the LSA. For the purpose of calculation of the cap, the spectrum being acquired through spectrum trading would be included in the total spectrum assigned. Total spectrum assigned for unpaired and both the uplink and downlink spectrum in the case of paired spectrum is to be taken into account, e.g. 2x5 MHz (i.e. 5 MHz of paired spectrum) shall be counte d as 10 MHz, whereas 20 MHz (unpaired spectrum) shall be counted as 20 MHz only. iv. The seller should clear its spectrum usage charges (SUC) and its instalment of payment (in case seller had acquired the spectrum through auction and opted for deferred paymen t) till the effective date of trade. Example: Consider the following hypothetical case of a schedule of payments in a case where the seller had opted for deferred payment: Schedule of payments Instalment Due date for payment Amount (Rs crore) Upfront payment 25-03-2013 330.00 First instalment 26-03-2016 129.93 Second instalment 26-03-2017 129.93 Third instalment 26-03-2018 129.93 Fourth instalment 26-03-2019 129.93 12 Fifth instalment 26-03-2020 129.93 Sixth instalment 26-03-2021 129.93 Seventh instalment 26-03-2022 129.93 Eighth instalment 26-03-2023 129.93 Ninth instalment 26-03-2024 129.93 Tenth instalment 26-03-2025 129.93 If the effective date of trade is 31 -03-2020, the seller must have cleared SUC due till that date as well as all the payments due up to and including the fifth instalment of deferred payment indicated in the table. v.

Where an issue, pertaining to the spectr um proposed to be transferred is pending adjudication before any court of law, the seller shall ensure that its rights and liabilities are transferred to the buyer as per the procedure prescribed under the law and any such transfer of spectrum will be perm itted only after the interest of the Licensor has been secured. 2.12 The buyer shall acquire a Wireless Operating Licence (WOL) or get the WOL amended, as the case may be, from the Wireless Planning & Coordination Wing (WPC) before using the spectrum acquired through spectrum trading. 2.13 The right to use the spectrum shall be subject to t he fulfillment of the relevant licence conditions and any other conditions that may be specified by the Licensor/Government from time to time. 2.14 A TSP i s permitted to sell either its entire spectrum holding in a spectrum band or a part of it. In each case, obligations of sellers and buyers will be as follows: Seller i. The seller will place details of proposed trade in the public domain at least six weeks before the effective date of transfer. ii. If a TSP (seller) sells the entire quantity of its spectrum in a band then the contingent roll -out obligations of that spectrum will stand transferred to the buyer. 13 iii. In case a TSP (seller) wishes to sell only a part of its spectrum holding in a particular band then:  The seller shall remain responsible for the roll -out obligations linked with that spectrum band.  The seller has to ensure that it continues to hold a minimum quantum of spectrum in that band so as to meet the roll -out obligations and Quality of Service (QoS) norms as prescribed by the TRAI/Licensor from time to time after the sale of spectrum. Buyer i. The buyer shall be responsible for the roll-out obligations linked with the spect rum being acquired through s pectrum trading. If it is acquiring the entire spectrum holding of the seller, then the time period for compliance of the roll -out obligations will remain the same as was originally prescribed, subject to a minimum period of two years, subject to the validity period of the spectrum. Example: Suppose the seller has 10 MHz of spectrum in a particular band in an LSA and it has roll-out obligations for a period of seven years. After a period of three years of holding, i f it sells its entire 10 MHz of spectrum holding, then, the buyer will get four years (i.e. remaining period for seller to fulfill its roll -out obligations)from the effective date of transfer to fulfill the roll -out obligations. If it sells its entire 10 MHz of spectrum holding, after a period of six years of holding, then, the buyer will get two years (and not one year) to fulfill the roll-out obligations. ii. If the buyer is acquiring a part of the spectrum holding of the seller in a spectrum band, then both buyer and seller will have spectrum holding in that band after the trade. In such a scenario, both will be responsible for the roll -out obligations. However, to fulfil the roll -out obligations, the buyer shall be entitled only to the time period as was originally provided during the assignment of the spectrum by the DoT. 14 Example: Suppose the seller has 10 MHz of spectrum in a particular band in an LSA and it has roll -out obligations for a period of seven years. If it sells part of its spectrum holding (say 5 MHz) , the seller shall remain responsible for the roll -out obligations linked to the spectrum in that band. The buyer shall also fulfill roll -out obligations linked with the spectrum band. In this case , buyer will get entire seven years from the effective date of transfer. iii.

The buyer has to ensure that, after trading, it acquires a minimum quantum of spectrum in that band so as to meet the roll -out obligations and QoS norms as prescribed by the TRAI/Licensor from time to time. 2.15 If the buyer does not intend to change the use of spectrum from its present usage, the issue of interference is not likely to arise. Only t he buyer may have to coordinate the use of frequencies w ith the neighbouring users. However, if, after s pectrum trading, spectrum is intended to be used for any purpose other than its present usage, then: i. Details of the technology, which the buyer intends to use, will have to be intimated to the WPC, so as to e nsure that the intended use does not create any interference with other users. ii. The buyer has to make a provision for the guard -bands from its spectrum holding to ensure that no interference is caused to the users holding adjacent spectrum. 2.16 A TSP will not be permitted to trade any spectrum in the spectrum band in which it has acquired any spectrum through trading (or auction) for a period of 2 years from the effective date of transfer of spectrum (or 15 effective date of assignment), i.e. TSP is required to hold spectrum for at least two years from the date it acquires the spectrum. 2.17 A non-refundable transfer fee of one percent (1%) of the transactional amount or one percent (1%) of the prescribed market price, whichever is higher shall be imposed on all spectrum trade transactions. The transfer fee shall be paid by the buyer (transferee) to the Government. 2.18 Frequency swapping/reconfiguration i.e. rearrangement of spot frequencies in the same band, from within the assignments made to the licensees will not be treated as trading of spectrum. 2.19 Existing rules applicable to Spectrum Usage Charge (SUC) shall continue to appl y on spectrum acquired through s pectrum trading. Spectrum acquired through spectrum trading will be treated akin to spectrum acquired through auction. 2.20 Process of Spectrum Trading: i. Spectrum trading would be a two party/licensee transaction. However, the seller is free to choose any suitable mechanism to find the prospective buyer (e.g. tender, auction etc). ii. Both the trading parties shall jointly give a prior intimation of 6 weeks before the effective date of the trade to the WPC. The transfer fee shall be paid by the buyer at the time of intimation. The intimation will be made to WPC in a prescribed format placed at Annexure I. iii. On receipt of intimation of proposed trade, the WPC will place the details of the prospective trade on its web -site, which will contain information about the seller and the buyer (name, address), their licence references, information about the spectrum (quantum of spectrum, frequencies), transaction amount, effective date as indicated by seller/buyer and all other relevant details. 16 iv.

For example, when a licencee is in material default of amounts due under its loan agreements with lenders, the lenders may initia te, with the permission of the L icensor, action for transfer or takeover of usage rights over spectrum to a selectee company who will then assume all the obligations and responsibilities of the previous hold er of usage rights towards the Licensor. 2.23 The tripartite agreement between the buyer of spectrum (licencee), Licensor, and lender (provided for under th e licence) should also incorporate a provision for seeking transfer, assignment, and endorsement of usage rights of the spectrum acquired through trading to a buyer/ selectee of the lender’s choice in the event of material default of the lender’s dues. While doing so, it has to be ensured that the tripartite agreement between th e seller of the spectrum (licens ee), the Licensor, and the seller’s lender is also amended to the extent of the quantum of spectrum traded. 2.24 The amended format of the Tripartite Agreement should be made a part of the Unified Licence Agreement. 18 Annexure I Sub: - Intimation for Trading for Spectrum We wish to buy/ sell the spectrum & the details are given below.

In India, there are 7 -13 licensees (2G, 3G and BWA) in a Licensed Service Area (LSA), which is a large number by any global standard1. As a result, spectrum holding per Telecom Service Provider (TSP) is small and fragmented. Spectrum fragmentation results in its less efficient utilisation. The basic objective of spectrum sharing is to provide an opportunity to the TSPs t o pool their spectrum holdings and thereby improve spectral efficiency. Sharing can also provide additional network capacities in places where there is network congestion due to a spectrum crunch. 2. To prepare its recommendations on ‘Guidelines for Spectrum Sharing, the Authority constituted a Steering Committee of senior officers of TRAI and representatives from various TSPs . Views of the Steering Committee were considered by the Authority before finalising these recommendations. The Authority had sent its Recommendations on “Guidelines on Spectrum Sharing” to the DoT on 21st July 2014. 3. Many of the recommendations have been referred back by the DoT to the Authority for reconsideration through its letter dated 2 7th April 2015. The Authority has gone through the DoT’s views on various recommendations and finalized its response. The Authority’s earlier recommendations, the views of the DoT thereon, and the response of the Authority are provided in Chapter II. 1 Many countries have only 4-5 licensees such as UK-4, Denmark-4 and Sweden-5. 2 CHAPTER-II: PARAWISE RESPONSE 1. Para 2.1 Spectrum sharing refers to an arrangement between two access licensees (CMTS/UASL/UL (AS)/UL) in a LSA, where both licensees having access spectrum in the same band, pool their respective spectrum in that LSA for their simultaneous use, using a common Radio Access Network (RAN) 2. The shared RAN will be connected to the core networks of each of the licensee. Both licensees will continue to hold their primary right over their own spectrum. 2 RAN refers to access network up to BSC in 2G net work, while in 3G networks, it refers to access network upto Radio Network Controller (RNC) and is known as Universal Terrestrial RAN (UTRAN). (TRAI Recommendation) DoT View Licensees having access spectrum as defined in UL will be permitted to share the spectrum in an LSA. Apart Basic/CMTS/UASL/UL (AS) licensees, ISPs may also be included as eligible. Response of TRAI It is essential to ensure that both the licensees pool (combine) their spectrum resources and also use it simultaneously ; otherwise it would be akin to spectrum leasing. Therefore, it is required to define the spectrum sharing the way it has been recommended above. Sharing of spectrum is a new concept. Therefore, to begin with, spectrum sharing, may be allowed only for the access service providers (CMTS/UASL/UL (AS)/UL with authori zation of Access Service) 3 2. Para 2.3 Only those sites shall be treated as spectrum -shared sites, where the spectrum resource of each of sharing licensees is used in the BTS. Both the licensees will be required to have a common RAN only in respect of sites being shared. It shall be up to the licensees to decide the actual area/BTSs in the LSA where they want to pool and share their spectru m resources as per their requirement and mutual agreement. However, it is simply not possible to monitor quantum of spectrum being shared at each site and to segregate the AGR site - wise/area-wise. Therefore, for the purpose of charging Spectrum Usage Charges (SUC), the licensor shall consider that the licensees are sharing their entire spectrum holding in the particular band in the entire LSA. Example 1: Licensees ‘A’ and ‘B’ have 8 MHz and 5 MHz spectrum respectively in the 1800 MHz band in Delhi LSA. Each of them pool 4 MHz and builds a common RAN. This arrangement of spectrum sharing is permissible.

Example 2: Licensees ‘A’ and ‘B’ have 8 MHz and 5 MHz spectrum respectively in the 1800 MHz band in Delhi LSA. Each of them pools their spectrum holding and builds a common RAN only in say Connaught Place area, whereas in other parts of the LSA, they do not share their spectrum.

Such arrangement of spectrum sharing is permissible. However, for the purpose of charging SUC, it will be considered that the licensee ‘A’ and ‘B’ are sharing their entire spectrum holding in 1800 MHz Band in the entire Delhi LSA. (TRAI Recommendation) 4 DoT View For the purpose of charging Spectrum Usage Charges (SUC), it is to be considered as the licensees are sharing their entire spectrum holding in the particular band in the entire LSA, the concept of spectrum – shared site does not have any relevance for this purpose. Response of TRAI As recommended by the Authority, for the purpose of charging Spectrum Usage Charges (SUC), the licensor shall consider that the licensees are sharing their entire spectrum holding in the particular band in the entire LSA. Regarding applicable rate of SUC, please refer to Para 2.22 of the recommendations. However, i t shall be up to the licensees to decide the actual area/BTSs in the LSA where they want to pool and share their spectrum resources as per their requirement and mutual agreement. In view of the above, the Authority reiterates its recommendation. 3. Para 2.4 All access spectrum i.e. spectrum in the bands of 800/900/1800/2100/ 2300/2500 MHz will be sharable provided that both the licensees are having spectrum in the same band. Example: It has been assumed that two Licensees ‘A’ and ‘B’ have spectrum holding in 900 MHz, 1800 MHz and 2100 MHz band as shown in Table below: Licensee Licensee A Licensee B Spectrum Band 900 MHz 1800 MHz 2100 MHz 900 MHz 1800 MHz 2100 MHz Spectrum holding (MHz) 6.2 3 0 0 4.4 5 5 These two licensees can share their spectrum holding in the 1800 MHz band because both of them have spectrum in this band. However, they cannot share spectrum in 900 MHz or 2100 MHz band because only one of them has spectrum in these bands. (TRAI Recommendation) DoT View TRAI is requested to clarify whether spectrum acquired through trading can also be shared. Response of TRAI Yes, spectrum acquired through trading can also be shared. 4. Para 2.7 A licensee shall not be eligible to share its spectrum if it has been established that it is in breach of terms and conditions of the licence and the licensor has ordered for revocation/termination of its licence after giving appropriate opportunity. (TRAI Recommendation) DoT View TRAI is requested to provide clarification of the following: (i) What should be done during notice period for termination/ revocation of the license or when such a notice is contemplated? (ii) What should be done when there are court case s against such notices? Response of TRAI The Authority reiterates its earlier recommendations. 6 5. Para 2.8 Both the licensees, willing to share their spectrum, shall inform the licensor at the time of entering into spectrum sharing agreement. No permission will be required from the Government for spectrum sharing. However, the Government shall have the right to annul the spectrum sharing agreement, if found to be flouting prescribed guidelines after giving due opportunity to the licensees. (Process described in Para 2.15 to 2.19) (TRAI Recommendation) DoT View TRAI is requested to provide suggestions for making amendments in license agreements/wireless operating licence and any other steps to be taken for sharing of spectrum. Response of TRAI The Authority is of the opinion that after finalisation of guidelines of spectrum sharing, the DoT may carry out appropriate modifications in the various clauses of the relevant licenses. 6. Para 2.9 At present, there are many licensees having administratively assigned spectrum in the 800 MHz, 900 MHz and 1800 MHz band. If any one or both of the licensees, sharing their spectrum, have administratively assigned spectrum in that band, then, after sharing, they will be permitted to provide only those services whi ch can be provided through the administratively held spectrum. Example: If one of the licensees has liberalised spectrum in 1800MHz band and other licensee, sharing the spectrum, has some spectrum as administratively held spectrum and some spectrum as lib eralised 7 spectrum in the same (1800MHz) band, then, after sharing their spectrum they can provide",

(TRAI Recommendation) DoT View (i). TRAI is requested to recommend methodology for liberalization of 900 MHz band spectrum. (ii). Following the principle of allowing use of any technology, TRAI is requested to consider that sharing of spectrum be permitted in respect of liberalized spectrum i.e. when both licensees have paid market price of the spectrum held by them which is proposed to be shared. Response of TRAI (i) & (ii) As brought out in Para 1.1 of the recommendations, the basic objective of spectrum sharing is to provide an opportunity to the TSPs to pool their spectrum holdings and thereby improve spectral efficiency. Sharing can also provide additional network capacities in places where there is network congestion due to a spectrum crunch. Liberalisation of spectrum is related to the liberty to use any technology. Therefore, the Authority has recommended in Para 2.9 above that i f any one or both of the licensees, sharing their spectrum, have administratively assigned spec trum in that band, then, after sharing, they will be permitted to provide only those services which can be provided through the administratively held spectrum. In view of the above, the Authority reiterates its recommendations. 8 The issue of liberalisation of 900 MHz band spectrum is not related to spectrum sharing guidelines. 7. Para 2.10 If both the licensees are sharing the spectrum in a band in which they have only that spectrum which is either acquired through an auction in the year 2010 or afterwards, or on which the licensee has already paid the prescribed market value 3 (as decided by the Government from time to time) to the Government, they can offer services using all those technologies (namely GSM, CDMA, WCDMA, LTE etc.), which they can independently p rovide through their own spectrum holding. For this purpose, the licensees are required to own a certain minimum amount of spectrum in that band throughout the currency of sharing. 3The prescribed market value shall be payable to the Government for the entire administratively assigned spectrum in that band after adjusting the entry fee paid by the Licensee for acquiring the spectrum (bundled with licence) prorated for the remaining validity of spectrum. (TRAI Recommendation) DoT View It is understood that prior to sharing of administratively assigned spectrum market price has to be paid for such spectrum to DoT. However, use of technology shall be governed by the terms and conditions of respective NIA/ license. TRAI in its recommendations of May 2010 recomm ended, among others, that spectrum sharing will not be permitted among licensees having 3G spectrum. Further TRAI has not defined the minimum amount of spectrum to be owned by the licensees throughout the currency of sharing. TRAI is requested to clarify the above. 9 Response of TRAI As stated in the response to Para 2. 9, the Authority is of the view that it is not required that prior to sharing of administratively assigned spectrum market price has to be paid for such spectrum. As brought out in Para 1.1 of the recommendations on spectrum sharing, the basic objective of spectrum sharing is to provide an opportunity to the TSPs to pool their spectrum holdings and thereby improve spectral efficiency. Therefore, the Authority does not find any plausible reason to exclude spectrum in 2100 MHz band from the list of the spectrum bands that can be shared. Both the licensees are required to fulfil specified roll -out obligations and prescribed QoS norms. Moreover, subsequent to sharing the licensees can offer only th ose services which they can offer through their own spectrum holding. To fulfil all these required obligations, the licensee itself can determine the minimum spectrum holding that it is required to hold. 8.

Para 2.11 Both licensees shall ensure that they fulf il the specified roll -out obligations and specified QoS norms. (TRAI Recommendation) DoT View The primary purpose behind roll out obligations is that spectrum is used by the licensee in a timely manner and that networks spread to wider parts of the service area. This also helps in improved probability of network infrastructure availability during d isaster. Hence, it is considered necessary that licensees should meet their roll out obligations without shared sites/RAN. Once roll out 10 obligations are met, the sites used for meeting roll out obligations may be shared. This will also be in line with TRAI recommendation in para 2.21 below. All obligations with respect to license conditions including for lawful interception and security shall be the individual responsibility of each licensee. TRAI is requested to provide its considered opinion in this regard. Response of TRAI The Authority agrees with the view of the DoT that a ll obligations with respect to license conditions including for lawful interception and security shall be the individual responsibility of each licensee. Being part of the licence, b oth licensees shall also be bound with the roll-out obligations and QoS norms. However, while testing roll -out obligations of each licensee, TERM Cell should ensure that only the spectrum resources assigned to that licensee are tested , irrespective of the fact whether the licensee has separate RAN or not. In view of the above, the Authority reiterates its recommendations. 9. Para 2.12 For sharing spectrum, a non -refundable processing fee @ Rs.50,000/ - (Rs. Fifty Thousand) will be payable individually by each licensee for each LSA to WPC for administrative purposes. (TRAI Recommendation) DoT View TRAI is requested to kindly indicate the rationale for recommending Rs. 50,000/- as processing fees. 11 Response of TRAI The processing fee is being imposed to cover the administrative charges. Therefore, the Authority has recommended a nominal amount of Rs. 50,000/- as processing fees. 10. Para 2.14 Both licensees will give an undertaking that, in case any interference is arising due to shar ing of their spectrum, they will resolve it within 30 days failing which they will stop sharing in the affected areas till the problem of interference is addressed. (TRAI Recommendation) DoT View The period of 30 days shall be reckoned with effect from date of issue of notice by the Government to resolve the cases of harmful interference. Response of TRAI The Authority agrees with the DoT’s view. 11. Para 2.20 Intimation regarding the sharing shall be provided by both the licensees to the licensor, TRAI and any other relevant agencies prescribed by the Government from time to time within 30 days from the effective date of sharing of spectrum. (TRAI Recommendation) DoT View Views in para 2.8 above may be referred. 12 Response of TRAI TRAI’ Response given in Para 2.8 may be referred to. 12. Para 2.22 SUC post-sharing: Spectrum sharing does not give exclusive rights of use to any one licensee. It helps create additional capacity that is useful mainly in those areas where anyone or both licensees are facing a capacity crunch. Therefore, the usefulness of gain in spectral efficiency due to pooling of spectrum resources will be limited only to those areas where there is congestion in the access network. Moreover, both licensees will be tied to each o ther and as such cannot plan the expansion of their shared network independently. Therefore, access to additional capacities created through spectrum sharing cannot be considered at par with that created through spectrum acquired through auction/trading. Sharing of spectrum by the two licensees will result in higher revenues for both of them. Therefore, both the licensee will also pay higher amount of SUC to the Government. However, considering the fact that spectrum sharing results in additional quantity of spectrum with both the licensees to serve higher number of consumers, the SUC rate of each of the licensees post -sharing shall increase by 0.5% of AGR.

Post-sharing SUC rates applicable in following three scenarios are given the Table below: Scenario I: They share their spectrum in the 1800 MHz band. Scenarios II: They share their spectrum in the 2100 MHz band. Scenario III: They share spectrum in both 1800 MHz and 2100 MHz bands.

(b) The TRAI in its recommendation of 2010 regarding SUC in case of sharing of spectrum, recommended, among others, the following: “Spectrum usage charges will be levied on both the operators individually but on the total spectrum held by both the operators together. In other words, if an operator X having 4.4MHz of 14 spectrum shares 4.4 MHz of spectrum of another operator Y, then both X and Y will be liable to pay spectrum usage charges applicable to 8.8 MHz of spectrum.” (c) Government has decided the following: The Spectrum Usage Charges (SUC), as prescribed by the Govt. from time to time, will be levied on both the operato rs individually for the total spectrum held by both the operators together. (d) Following type of SUC regimes are prevalent: a. Rates of SUC vary with methodology of allotment of spectrum i.e. (i) allotted administratively or (ii) through auction process in 800 M Hz, 900 MHz, 1800 MHz and 2100MHz bands. b. Further, the rates of SUC vary with quantum of spectrum and provisions of the NIA for auction of spectrum through which spectrum has been allotted. c. In case of spectrum in 2100 MHz (3G), the prescribed rates of SUC as NIA for auction of spectrum in 2010 are: (i) The spectrum charge for the 3G Spectrum shall be payable on total AGR of 2G and 3G services taken together; (ii) Slab rate for standalone 3G operators shall be equal to the lowest slab rate i.e. 3% of AGR; d. In case of spectrum in 2300/2500 MHz (BWA), the prescribed rates of SUC as NIA for auction of spectrum in 2010 is: Licensees using BWA Spectrum need to pay 1% of AGR from services using this spectrum as annual spectrum charge irrespective of the licence held by them. Such revenue would be required to be reported separately. 15 e. Spectrum Usage Charges (SUC) has been prescribed for the spectrum in 900 MHz and 1800 MHz bands, as per the Order No. P -14010/01/2014-NTG dated 31 st October 2014. f. Spectrum Usage Charges (SU C) has been prescribed for the spectrum in 800 MHz, 900 MHz, 1800 MHz and 2100 MHz bands, as per the Order No. P-14010/01/2014 dated 5thFebruary, 2015. (e) In view of above applicable SUC rates, particularly the weighted average SUC prescribed rates, TRAI is r equested to reconsider the SUC to be applicable in case of sharing. (f) The example in Table showing sharing of spectrum in 2100 MHz band in Scenario II and III, indicates sharing even when Licensee A does not hold spectrum in 2100 MHz band, which is not as per recommendation of TRAI in para 2.4.

Response of TRAI (a) TRAI’ Response given in Para 2.9 and 2.10 may be referred to. (b) to (e) Please refer to Para 1.3 and 1.4 of the recommendations on spectrum sharing dated 21 st July 201 4, where in the Authority’s earlier recommendation on spectrum sharing given on 11th May 2010 and the Government decision taken on the same had been discussed. Keeping in view the complexities involved in determining the SUC for various quantum of spectrum acquired through different methodologies, the Authority in its recommendations dated 9th September 2013 had recommended that SUC for all auctioned spectrum sho uld be at a flat rate of 3% of AGR of wireless services. The reasons for the same are available in 16 paras 5.1 to 5.32 of its recommendations of 9th September 2013. As far as SUC in case of spectrum sharing is concerned, the Authority has recommended that the SUC rate of each of the licensees post-sharing shall increase by 0.5% of AGR. Keeping the SUC regime simple and unambiguous is one of the foremost objectives of this recommendation. In view of the above, the Authority reiterates its recommendations. (f) In its back reference, t he DoT has erred in reproducing the table given in example at page no. 10 of the Authority’s recommendations, due to which it has incorrectly pointed out that spectrum holding of one of the licensee in 2100 MHz band has been shown as NIL. In fact, b oth the licensees have spectrum holding in 1800 MHz and 2100 MHz band , where sharing of spectrum has been considered to illustrate the SUC post spectrum sharing. 13. Para 2.23 Spectrum Caps: As discussed in Para 2.22, additional capacities created through spectrum sharing cannot be counted at par with those created through spectrum acquired through auction/trading. However, considering the fact that spectrum sharing results in better spectral efficiency, a portion of additional capacity created needs to be counted for the purpose of applying the prescribed spectrum caps of 25% of total spectrum assigned and 50% in a band. For the limited purpose of applying the prescribed market caps, the spect rum holding of any licensee post-sharing shall be counted as given below: 17 50% of the spectrum held by the other licensee in the band being shared shall be counted as the additional spectrum being held by the licensee. Example: Licensee ‘A’ and ‘B’ have sp ectrum in quantum X and Y respectively in a band, in which they decide to share their spectrum. The spectrum holding in that band subsequent to sharing, only for the purpose of applying the stipulated spectrum cap, shall be considered as per the following table. Quantum of spectrum in a band before sharing Quantum of spectrum after sharing that will be counted as the spectrum being held in this band for the purpose of applying the stipulated spectrum cap Licensee ‘A’ X X+(Y/2) Licensee ‘B’ Y Y+(X/2) (TRAI Recommendation) DoT View The TRAI in its recommendations of May 2010 recommended, among others, the following:  Permission for spectrum sharing will be given for a maximum period of 5 years. There shall be no renewal.  Spectrum sharing will be allowed only between parties each of whom does not have more than 4.4MHz /2.5 MHz (GSM/CDMA) of spectrum.  Sharing will be allowed only if there are at least six operators in the LSA, post-sharing arrangement.  Spectrum sharing will not be permitted among licensees having 3G spectrum. The Government decided the following: 18 Cabinet Decision Sharing of spectrum without any additional one time spectrum charge, be permitted between TSPs that have both paid for spectrum beyond 4.4 MHz (GSM) / 2.5 MHz (CDMA.) without any change in the terms and conditions of licence for use of spectrum including the carrier size indicated therein. Both TSPs would have to pay spectrum usage charge at the slab rate applicable on the entire combined spectrum holding. DOT",

DOT Decision on 15.2.2012 Spectrum usage charges will be levied on both the operators individually but on the total spectrum held by both the operators together. In other words, if an operator ‘X’ having 4.4MHz of spectrum shares 4.4 MHz of spectrum of another operator ‘Y’, then both ‘X’ and ‘Y’ will be liable to pay spectrum usage charges applicable to 8.8 MHz of spectrum. It is noted that the spectrum sharing results in better spectral efficiency and the benefit of which shall accrue to both. Further, impact of consolidation of s pectrum being similar there appears to be no reasonable justification for differentiating the spectrum holding in the case of M&A, spectrum trading, spectrum sharing or standalone basis. TRAI is requested to reconsider this recommendation. Response of TRAI Please refer to Para 1.3 and 1.4 of the recommendations on spectrum sharing dated 21 st July 2014, wherein the Authority’s earlier recommendation on spectrum sharing given on 11 th May 2010 and the Government decision taken on the same had been discussed.

Accordingly, the Radio Regulations (Edition of 2020 ) is the foundational text used for drawing up the National Frequen cy Allocation Plan 2022 (NFAP-2022). 1.3 The central theme of NFAP -2022 is the allocation of radi o-frequency spectrum to different radiocommunication services as detailed in the column named “India” in the Table of Frequency Allocations in Section B of Chapter 3. NFAP-2022 covers the frequency range up to 3000 GHz. 1.4 NFAP-2022, though governing the use of spectrum in India, does not by itself provide the right to use the spectrum. Before any part of the spectrum is put to use in India, a licence is required to be obtained from the Wireless Planning and Coordination Wing (WPC Wing), Ministry of Communications, unless such a requirement is exempted by the WPC Wing. 1.5 With a view to providing a stable, yet flexible, regulatory framework, NFAP-2022 doesn’t attempt to list the various applications (uses) of the individual radiocommunication services tha t are currently authorised or may be authorised in future in India. WPC Wing may, having consulted as it considers appropriate, provide for new applications of individual radiocommunication services while ensuring conformity with the provisions of the Radio Regulations. Section B ⎯ Frequency Allocations and NFAP-2022 1.6 In order that all radiocommunication services — forty one in total (the 41 st being special service) ⎯ have effective access to frequencies, the spectrum is divided into frequency bands and each band is allocated to one or more radiocommunication services. The principle of designating a band for the use by specified radiocommunication services is referred to as frequency allocation. 1.7 For the purpose of frequency allocation, the world has been divided into three Regions. They are referred to as Region 1, Region 2 and Region 3 in the Radio Regulations. The three Regions are as shown in the map* below. India is within Region 3. It should be noted that w here the words “regions” CHAPTER 1: National Frequency Allocation Plan 2022: An Overview - 2 - or “regional” are without a capital “R” in this document, they do not relate to the three Regions defined for purposes of frequency allocation. Regions in the Radio Regulations 1.8 Where a frequency band is allocated to more than one radiocommunication service, each service using the band is categorised either as a “primary” service or a “secondary” service. A station in a secondary service can’t cause harmful interference to stations of primary services, nor can it claim protection from harmful interference originating from stations of primary services, irrespective of the date the stations in the primary services begin operating. 1.9 Any entity (public and private bodies, as also in dividuals), intending to use the spectrum in India, can determine from the Frequency Allocation Table in Section B of Chapter 3 which frequency bands are available for the radiocommunication services of its interest. 1.10 A radiocommunication service usually encompasses more than one application. For example, cellular mobile service (2G, 3G, 4G and to be introduced, 5G,), Wi -Fi, radio trunking, radio paging, walkie-talkies and several others come under",

CHAPTER 1: National Frequency Allocation Plan 2022: An Overview - 3 - includes sound broadcasting as well as television broadcasting. As the use of the spectrum is not static, and that the introduction of ever new application of spectrum is determined by demands from citizens and the industry, NFAP-2022 doesn’t list the various applications of any radiocommunication service. In a few cases, however, applications of a radiocommunication service in specific frequency bands have been indicated in the India footnote to the Table of Frequency Allocation in Section B of Chapter 3. 1.11 Frequency allocation is the first step towards ensuring efficient, rational, and interference-free use of the radio -frequency spectrum and satellite -orbits (geostationary and non -geostationary) ⎯ the natural, limited resources. The conditions (techni cal, procedural and regulatory) for using the radio - frequency spectrum and satellite -orbits come under the licensing -regime. Accordingly, NFAP-2022 doesn’t address the licensing aspects of the use of the spectrum-orbital resources. 1.12 The IMT 2020 or 5G services with its enhanced capabilities has relevance cutting across industry verticals. To take advantage of 5G services for Digital India, the new frequency bands are added in NFAP 2022 where additional spectrum is added for IMT in frequency bands below 1 GHz, 70 MHz additional spectrum is added in mid band below 4 GHz and 16750 MHz additional spectrum is added in frequency bands above 24 GHz. This would enable new additional spectrum for upcoming 5G services. 1.13 Satellite services and domestic manufacturing in new areas such as high throughput satellites and broadband proliferation are encouraged in NFAP 202 2. New applications such as use of High Altitude Platform Stations are providing prospects to connect even the remotest areas a nd have promising use cases. 1.14 Short-range Devices (SRDs) and devices using Ultra -wideband (UWB) technology make use of the radio -frequency spectrum. SRDs and UWB -devices are fast assuming crucial importance to citizens as well as specialized public and private sectors (e.g., medical implants, ground-probing radars, the latter for use by security and utility agencies). Machine -to-Machine (M2M) communications and Internet of Things (IoT) largely depend upon SRDs and UWB-devices. These devices are, however, not considered as providing radiocommunication services and are usually kept out of the purview Radio Regulations. For ready reference, Annex-1 presents the list of applications which have been declared ‘license-exempt’ by the WPC Wing. Annex-2 lists the commonly used frequencies for specific uses. 1.15 The terms such as allocation, assignment, radio astronomy, safety service which appear in the Frequency Allocation Table and the associated footnotes have specific definitions in the Radio Regulations. These terms are defined in “Chapter 2: Terms and Definitions.” 1.16 Frequency Allocation Table is complemented with its footnotes. The Radio Regulations qualify the frequency allocations made to the three Regions with the footnotes. These footnotes, usually known as International Footnotes, are reproduced in Section C of Chapter 3. India specific footnotes, identified by the prefix “IND” and followed by a number, appear onl y in column 4 of the Table of Frequency Allocations in Section B of Chapter 3. These footnotes qualify the use of the frequency band(s) in India and are shown in Section D of Chapter 3.
